## Restrictions on Generative AI Usage
We expect authentic engagement in our community.

If you use generative AI tools as an aid in developing code or documentation changes, ensure that you fully understand the proposed changes and can explain why they are the correct approach.

If you do not fully understand some bits of the AI generated code, call out unknowns and assumptions. You should comment on these cases and point them out to reviewers so that they can use their knowledge of the codebase to clear up any concerns. For example, you might comment “calling this function here seems to work but I’m not familiar with how it works internally, I wonder if there’s a race condition if it is called concurrently”.

Make sure you have added value based on your personal competency to your contributions. Just taking some input, feeding it to an AI and posting the result is not of value to the project. To preserve precious core developer capacity, we reserve the right to rigorously reject seemingly AI generated low-value contributions.

## The RFC (Request for Comments) Process

Before you start writing code for a new feature or a significant architectural change, you **must** create an RFC:

1.  **Open an Issue:** Create a new GitHub Issue with the prefix `[RFC] Your Feature Name`.
2.  **Design Proposal:** Provide a general design or technical overview of your approach. Explain the *why* and the *how*.
3.  **Tag a Maintainer:** Tag @arseny-kostenko, @ravjotbrar, @ArgusLi, and/or, @nassery318
4.  **Approval:** Wait for feedback and approval from the project contributors. 
5.  **Proceed:** Once the design is approved, you are cleared to begin development and submit a PR.

*Note: Small bug fixes or documentation typos do not require an RFC.*

## Technical Architecture & Patterns

To ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase, please adhere to the following architectural patterns:

### Repository Architecture
* **Frontend (`apps/frontend`):** React/Electron UI. It talks to the local app backend primarily through websocket actions and consumes RTK state through selectors.
* **Server (`apps/server`):** Local Node backend. It serves the frontend with Express REST/static routes and handles websocket actions for Valkey connection, command, dashboard, config, and monitoring workflows.
* **Metrics (`apps/metrics`):** Metrics sidecar/service. It exposes REST endpoints for collected time-series data and writes/streams metric snapshots.
* **Common (`common/`):** Shared constants, types, formatting, parsing, and pure utilities used across apps.

Keep boundaries clear:
* Do not import frontend code into server or metrics code.
* Keep Valkey client and transport details out of React components.
* Normalize API and Valkey responses at ingestion boundaries: server handlers, middleware, reducers, or shared parsers.
* Prefer reusing existing types over copying shapes. Reuse API/schema/domain types for component props when the component truly consumes that shape.

### State Management & Components
* **RTK as Source of Truth:** RTK slices and selectors are the source of truth for app/domain state.
* **Intent Actions:** Components should dispatch intent actions and consume selectors. Avoid anonymous `useSelector((state) => ...)` in components.
* **Selectors:** Put single-slice selectors near the slice. Put selectors that join multiple state areas in a domain selector file; create a shared/global selector file only when the cross-slice selector does not belong to one domain.
* **Compute Pattern:** Derived Redux fields are valid when intentional. Use the compute pattern when prepared view data improves render simplicity, consistency, or performance.
* **Presentational Components:** Components should focus on rendering prepared state and dispatching actions. Avoid embedding business logic or transport details directly within React components.
* **Local UI State:** React component state should be reserved for local UI concerns such as controlled inputs, toggle states, and transient interaction state.

### Side Effects & Async Flows
We use **RxJS-based middleware (Epics)** to handle side effects and asynchronous logic.
* **Middleware First:** Use middleware/epics for websocket sends, API calls, action chaining, retries, timers, polling, debouncing, and async coordination.
* **Observable Pipelines:** Side effects are modeled as streams of actions. Epics should listen for specific actions and emit new actions using observable pipelines.
* **Pure Reducers:** Keep side effects out of both components and reducers to maintain predictability.
* **No Data Flow Effects:** Avoid `useEffect` for application data flow. Components should not use effects to fetch data, sync Redux state, chain actions, or coordinate websocket/API workflows.

### Hooks Organization
* **Global Hooks:** The `/hooks` folder is strictly for global or truly reusable hooks shared across multiple components.
* **Local Hooks:** If a function or hook is used by only one component, it should live in a file adjacent to that component's file, not in the global directory.
* **Hook Scope:** Hooks are appropriate for reusable component-local behavior, browser/DOM integration, and small UI interaction state. Do not use hooks as hidden service layers for API orchestration, Redux-derived state, websocket flows, retries, polling, or action chaining.
* **External Stores:** For external stores or subscription-based browser/runtime state, prefer `useSyncExternalStore` so React owns snapshot consistency.
* **Manual Memoization:** Do not add `useMemo` or `useCallback` by default. Prefer straightforward code, selectors, compute steps, stable component boundaries, and React Compiler.

### Types & Errors
* **`undefined` vs `null`:** Keep them distinct. `undefined` means a field or value is absent, not requested, not loaded, or not applicable to that shape. `null` means the source explicitly returned no value.
* **Avoid Nil Drift:** Do not use `R.isNil` where the `undefined`/`null` distinction matters. Avoid optional fields that can also be `null` unless both states are real.
* **Type Reuse:** Keep type definitions aligned with source semantics. Do not widen types to make call sites easier unless the wider state really exists.
* **Expected Errors:** Prefer return-style error objects for expected domain failures, validation failures, unsupported Valkey capabilities, and recoverable API outcomes.
* **Thrown Errors:** Throw for programmer errors, impossible states, startup/config failures, or framework-required exception flows.
* **Secrets:** Never log passwords, IAM tokens, credentials, connection strings with secrets, or raw secure-storage payloads. Redact sensitive connection details in logs and errors.

### Agent Skills
Detailed guidance for AI coding agents lives in `.agents/skills/` and should be loaded only when relevant:
* `ramda`: transformation-heavy TypeScript or JavaScript.
* `rx-js`: Redux slices, selectors, epics, websocket flows, and frontend data orchestration.
* `valkey`: Valkey connection, command, dashboard, metrics, key-browser, monitoring, and cluster behavior.
* `react`: React components, hooks, JSX structure, and frontend render data flow.
* `styling`: Tailwind classes, CSS tokens, themes, layout, and visual UI states.

### Consistency
Before contributing, please take the time to familiarize yourself with the existing codebase and conventions. We value consistency in patterns and naming above all else.

## Development Environment Setup

### Desktop App Setup

For the full-featured desktop application:

1. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
2. **Start Valkey cluster:** `./tools/valkey-cluster/scripts/build_run_cluster.sh`
3. **Build desktop app:**
   - macOS: `npm run package:mac:nosign`
   - Linux: `npm run package:linux:nosign`
4. **Launch app:** Find the built app in `release/` folder and launch it
5. **Connect:** Manually add a connection to `localhost:7001`

### Web Development Setup

For development servers (limited features - no hotkeys/commandlogs):

1. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
2. **Start Valkey cluster:** `./tools/valkey-cluster/scripts/build_run_cluster.sh`
3. **Start dev servers:** `npm run dev` or use `./quickstart-web.sh`
4. **Connect:** Open http://localhost:5173 and manually add connection to `localhost:7001`

### Windows/WSL Users

Fix line endings before running scripts:
```bash
sed -i 's/\r$//' tools/valkey-cluster/scripts/build_run_cluster.sh
sed -i 's/\r$//' tools/valkey-cluster/scripts/cluster_init.sh
chmod +x tools/valkey-cluster/scripts/*.sh
```

### Shutting Down

```bash
cd tools/valkey-cluster
docker compose down -v
```

## IDE Setup

### VSCode

The repository includes settings for the ESLint extension. Please install it.

**Note:** If you have a formatter i.e. Prettier, it could interfere with the ESLint extension. Please disable it from the workspace.

This requires ESLint v9.0.0 and above.

## Create DMG

You are able to build notarized or non-notarized Applications.

### Unnotarized Application

#### Overview
    - Much faster build process.
    - While you won't encounter any issues running this on the system that built it, distributing the DMG will lead to a `"Valkey Admin" is damaged and can't be opened` error when running the application. To bypass this, run `xattr -c <path/to/app>` in terminal to disable the quarantine flag.

#### Process
In the root directory, create a DMG by running `npm run package:mac:nosign`.

### Notarized Application

#### Overview
    - Much slower build process (could be hours the first time, and up to 10 minutes consequently).
    - Has additional requirements listed in `mac_build`.

#### Process
In the root directory, create a DMG by running `npm run package:mac`.

Note: you will see
```
• skipped macOS notarization  reason=`notarize` options were set explicitly `false`
```
This is as we are not using electron builder's notarization tool, rather electron-notarize.

## Coding Standards

### Linting & Formatting
We use **ESLint v9.0.0+** to maintain code quality.
* **No Prettier:** Please **disable Prettier** in your IDE workspace for this project. It interferes with our ESLint configuration.
* **Automatic Linting:** We recommend the ESLint extension for VSCode. The repository includes settings to help you follow our style guide automatically.
