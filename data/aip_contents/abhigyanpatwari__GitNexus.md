## GitHub Actions — Concurrency Convention

Every workflow under `.github/workflows/` MUST declare a top-level `concurrency:` block using this convention:

- **Group key** starts with `${{ github.workflow }}` so no two workflows can collide on the same group name. The discriminator that follows is chosen per event shape:
  - Branch/tag scope: `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}`
  - Per-PR scope (for `issue_comment`, `pull_request_review*`, `pull_request` meta events): `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }}`
  - `workflow_run` scope (e.g. `ci-report.yml`): `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.workflow_run.pull_requests[0].number || format('{0}/{1}', github.event.workflow_run.head_repository.full_name, github.event.workflow_run.head_branch) }}` — the fork fallback must be stable across reruns (never `workflow_run.id`, which is per-run-unique and defeats serialization).
  - Global single-slot (manual dispatch utilities): `${{ github.workflow }}`
  - **Reusable workflows invoked via `workflow_call`:** do NOT use `${{ github.workflow }}` in the group key — in called-workflow context its evaluation is ambiguous and can resolve to the caller's name, which would deadlock against the caller's own group. Use a hardcoded literal prefix and a `github.event_name`-aware expression that falls through to `github.run_id` for reusable invocations (see `ci.yml` for the canonical form). Approved literal prefixes: `CI-` (`ci.yml`) and `docker-build-push-` (`docker.yml`). The `check-workflow-concurrency.py` validation script must be updated whenever a new approved literal prefix is added.
  - **Merge queue (`merge_group`)**: when this event is added, use `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.merge_group.head_ref }}` with `cancel-in-progress: false` (every queue entry is a distinct ref; never cancel).
- **`cancel-in-progress` policy:**

  | Event | `cancel-in-progress` | Why |
  |-------|----------------------|-----|
  | `pull_request` CI run | `true` | New push supersedes old run |
  | `push` to `main` | `false` | Every main commit gets validated |
  | Tag push (`v*` publish) | `false` | Never cancel mid-publish |
  | `push` to `main` for release-candidate | `false` | Never cancel mid-RC publish |
  | `workflow_dispatch` (release/publish) | `false` | Manual runs are intentional |
  | `workflow_run` (sticky-comment reports) | `false` | Serialize, don't race |
  | Per-PR bot workflows (`@claude`, review) | `false` | Serialize comments per PR |
  | PR-meta re-checks (pr-description-check) | `true` | Cheap, latest wins |
  | Single-slot utilities (triage sweep) | `true` | Latest dispatch supersedes |

- For workflows that serve multiple events at once (e.g. `ci.yml` handles `pull_request`, `push`, and `workflow_call`), make `cancel-in-progress` event-aware:

  ```yaml
  concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
  ```

- When adding a new workflow, copy the concurrency block from an existing workflow of the same event shape.

If you use coding agents, follow project context files (e.g. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) and avoid drive-by refactors unrelated to the issue. Prefer incremental, test-backed changes.
