# Contributing to Platformatic Kafka

Welcome to the Platformatic Kafka development guide! This document will help you set up your development environment and contribute to the project.

## Project Overview

Platformatic is an open-source, modern, high-performance, pure TypeScript/JavaScript type safe client for Apache Kafka.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 20.19.4, 22.18.0 or 24.6.0 or higher
- **pnpm**: Package manager (follow the [pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation))
- **Docker** (optional): Only required for running tests locally.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/platformatic/kafka.git
cd kafka
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4. Setup Docker Environment (Optional)

This step is only required if you plan to run tests locally.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Development Workflow

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Development workflow
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm run build         # Build the package
pnpm run lint          # Lint the package
```

### Testing

Tests require Docker for Kafka cluster setup.

```
docker compose up -d
```

You can eventually provide a `KAFKA_VERSION` environment variable to select a specific version of Kafka.
Note that the images use Confluent Kafka so you need to add 4 to your desider version. For instance, to run on Kafka 3.9.0:

```
bash
KAFKA_VERSION=7.9.0 docker compose up -d
```

Then you run the test normally:

```bash
pnpm test
```

#### Memory Tests

Memory tests (`test/memory/*.memory-test.ts`) are not part of the regular test suite or CI.
They use `--expose-gc` and a 3-broker cluster with sustained backpressure to detect heap
leaks in the consumer stream. Run them manually when modifying the consumer stream, fetch
loop, or backpressure handling:

```bash
pnpm run test:memory
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure all tests pass: `pnpm test`
2. Run linting: `pnpm run lint`
3. Build all packages: `pnpm run build`

### Creating a Pull Request

1. If your PR fixes a GitHub issue, add this at the top of the PR description:

```
Fixes #<issue-number>.
```

2. Ensure all checks pass and get approval
3. Merge using "squash and merge" option

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All contributions must include a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off. Use the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This automatically adds your `Signed-off-by` line to the commit message. If working with AI assistance, ensure both contributors are signed off.
