## Getting Started

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana.git
   cd garmin-grafana
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python 3.12+ and uv package manager installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   uv sync --locked
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the `pyproject.toml` file to install the dependencies with pip.  
   
3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `override-default-vars.env` file in the root directory and add necessary ENV variables (make sure to add this to the .gitignore file so you don't accidentally commit that file). You can also export the ENV varibles to the shell environment directly.  
   
4. **Set up external InfluxDB and Grafana with Containers**

   You should deploy an external InfluxDB database and Grafana container for full test environment setup. This is important if you are adding now measurement or modifying an existing one.  
   
5. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   uv run src/garmin_grafana/garmin_fetch.py
   ```
   
   This should start fetching data from Garmin and populate your InfluxDB database.
