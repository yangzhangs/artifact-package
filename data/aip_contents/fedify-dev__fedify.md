### Branch policy

Fedify follows a structured branching strategy for managing releases and
maintenance:

#### Branch types

 -  **next**: Contains unreleased development for the next major version.
 -  **main**: Contains unreleased development for the next minor version.
 -  **x.y-maintenance**: Maintenance branches for released major/minor versions
    (e.g., *1.5-maintenance*, *1.6-maintenance*).

#### Target branches

 -  **Breaking changes**: Target the *next* branch.
 -  **New features**: Target the *main* branch.
 -  **Bug fixes**: Target the oldest applicable maintenance branch that contains
    the bug.

#### Release and merge strategy

When a bug is fixed in a maintenance branch:

1.  Fix the bug in the oldest affected maintenance branch
    (e.g., *1.5-maintenance*).
2.  Create a new patch release tag (e.g., `1.5.1`).
3.  Merge the fix into the next maintenance branch (e.g., *1.6-maintenance*).
4.  Create a new patch release tag for that branch (e.g., `1.6.1`).
5.  Continue merging forward through all subsequent maintenance branches.
6.  Merge into *main*.
7.  Finally merge into *next*.

This ensures that all maintenance branches and the development branches
include the fix.

### Bug fix

If you want to fix a bug in Fedify, please search the [GitHub issue tracker] to
see if the bug has already been reported.  If it hasn't been reported yet,
please open a new issue to discuss the bug.

When you open a pull request, please provide the issue number that the pull
request is related to.

A patch set should include the following:

 -  The regression test that demonstrates the bug.  It should fail without the
    patch and pass with the patch.
 -  The fix for the bug.
 -  The *CHANGES.md* entry.  The entry should include the issue number,
    the pull request number, and your name (unless you want to be anonymous).

Bug fix pull requests should target the oldest maintenance branch that
the bug affects.  If you are not sure which branch to target, please ask in the
issue tracker.

### Feature implementation

If you want to contribute to Fedify, please open a new issue in the
[GitHub issue tracker] to discuss the change you want to make.  If the change
is accepted, you can start working on the change.  When you open a pull
request, please provide the following information:

 -  The issue number that the pull request is related to.
 -  The description of the change.
 -  The reason why the change is needed.
 -  The steps to test the change.

A patch set should include the following:

 -  The unit tests that demonstrate the feature.
 -  The implementation of the feature.
 -  If any API change was made, the documentation update for the API.
 -  Check if examples work with the change, and update the examples if needed.
 -  The *CHANGES.md* entry.  The entry should include the issue number,
    the pull request number, and your name (unless you want to be anonymous).

Feature pull requests should target the *main* branch for non-breaking changes,
or the *next* branch for breaking changes.

### Adding a new package

When adding a new package to the monorepo, the following files must be updated:

**Required updates:**

1.  *AGENTS.md* and *CONTRIBUTING.md*: Add the package to the repository
    structure list.
2.  *README.md*: Add the package to the “Packages” section table.
3.  *package.json*: Add the `repository` field to the package metadata.
    This is required for provenance information when publishing to npm.
4.  Root *deno.json*: Add the package path to the `workspace` array.
5.  *pnpm-workspace.yaml*: Add the package path to the `packages` array.

**Conditional updates:**

 -  If the package is a web framework integration: Update
    *docs/manual/integration.md*.
 -  If the package implements `KvStore`: Update *docs/manual/kv.md*.
 -  If the package implements `MessageQueue`: Update *docs/manual/mq.md*.
 -  If the package is published to JSR: Ensure the package's *deno.json*
    contains the correct `name` and `publish` metadata.  The docs “References”
    section is generated automatically from publishable workspace packages, so
    no manual change to *docs/.vitepress/config.mts* is needed.

**Optional updates:**

 -  If special dependencies are needed: Add to `imports` in root *deno.json*.
 -  If using pnpm catalog for dependency management: Add to `catalog` in
    *pnpm-workspace.yaml*.

### Adding a web framework integration

A step-by-step guide for implementing a web framework integration package is
available in *.agents/skills/create-integration-package/SKILL.md*.  Although
the file is primarily designed for AI coding agents, the instructions are
written so that human contributors can also read and follow them.  The guide
covers the entire workflow from researching the framework through creating
the package, adding it to `fedify init`, testing, and writing an example.

### Dependency management

Fedify uses two package managers:

 -  **Deno**: For Deno-based packages.  The lockfile is *deno.lock*.
 -  **pnpm**: For Node.js-based packages.  The lockfile is *pnpm-lock.yaml*.

Both lockfiles are committed to the repository to ensure reproducible builds and
consistent dependency resolution across all environments.  When you add, update,
or remove dependencies, you must commit the updated lockfile(s) along with your
changes.

To update both lockfiles at once, run:

~~~~ bash
mise run install
~~~~

When reviewing pull requests, please check that lockfile changes are included
for any dependency-related changes.

#### Adding dependencies

Because this project supports both Deno and Node.js/Bun, dependencies must
be added to *both* configuration files:

 -  *deno.json*: Add to the `imports` field (for Deno).
 -  *package.json*: Add to `dependencies` or `devDependencies` (for Node.js/Bun).

For workspace packages, use the pnpm catalog (*pnpm-workspace.yaml*) to manage
versions centrally.  In *package.json*, reference catalog versions with
`"catalog:"` instead of hardcoding version numbers.

When adding dependencies that are published to both JSR and npm (like Optique),
use the appropriate package registry for each configuration:

 -  *deno.json*: Use the JSR package (e.g., `jsr:@optique/core`).
 -  *package.json*: Use the npm package (e.g., `@optique/core`).

This ensures optimal compatibility with each runtime environment while
maintaining the same functionality across both Deno and Node.js/Bun.

When the JSR and npm package names differ (like Hono: `jsr:@hono/hono` vs
`hono`), align imports to the npm package name in *deno.json* using an alias:

~~~~
"hono": "jsr:@hono/hono@^4.0.0"
~~~~

This allows consistent imports across both environments using the npm package
name (e.g., `import { Hono } from "hono"`).

Forgetting to add a dependency to *package.json* will cause Node.js and Bun
tests to fail with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, even if Deno tests pass.

#### Updating `fedify init` template dependencies

The `fedify init` command generates projects with third-party dependencies
whose versions are defined in *packages/init/src/json/*.  Most web-framework
and common tool versions live in *deps.json*, while KV store and message queue
versions are in *kv.json* and *mq.json* respectively.

To update all of these to the latest releases automatically, run:

~~~~ bash
mise run update-init-deps
~~~~

The script queries the npm and JSR registries for the latest version of each
package, respecting the current major version (caret range).  After running
it, verify the init package still works:

~~~~ bash
mise run test:init
~~~~

When adding a new third-party dependency to a web-framework template, add it to
*deps.json* and reference it from the TypeScript file via the `deps` import.
Dependencies that are specific to KV stores or message queues should be added
directly to *kv.json* or *mq.json* instead.

### Commit messages

 -  Do not use Conventional Commits (no `fix:`, `feat:`, etc. prefixes).
    Keep the first line under 50 characters when possible.

 -  Focus on *why* the change was made, not just *what* changed.

 -  When referencing issues or PRs, use permalink URLs instead of just
    numbers (e.g., `#123`).  This preserves context if the repository
    is moved later.

 -  When listing items after a colon, add a blank line after the colon:

    ~~~~
    This commit includes the following changes:

    - Added foo
    - Fixed bar
    ~~~~

### Changelog entries

When adding entries to *CHANGES.md*, follow these conventions:

 -  Use ` -  ` (one space, hyphen, two spaces) for list items.

 -  Wrap lines at approximately 80 characters, and indent continuation lines
    by 4 spaces so they align with the bullet text.

 -  Write concrete, user-facing descriptions.  Include what changed, why it
    changed, and what users should do differently (especially for breaking
    changes).

 -  Use `[[#123]]` markers for issue/PR references, with reference links at
    the end of the version section:

    ~~~~
     -  Fixed a bug where foo would bar.  [[#123]]

    [#123]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/123
    ~~~~

 -  When the reference is for a PR authored by an external contributor, append
    `by <NAME>` after the reference marker (e.g., `[[#123] by John Doe]`).

### Pull request builds

Pre-release versions can be published for pull requests on request.  If you need
a pre-release version to test your changes, ask a maintainer in the PR comments.
A maintainer can then trigger the pre-release build from the GitHub Actions tab.

The version number of the pre-release version consists of the base version
number, the pull request number, the build number, and the commit hash, which
looks like `1.2.3-pr.456.789+abcdef01`.  Once published, a comment will be
posted on the PR with the exact version numbers and installation instructions.

### Development environment

Fedify uses [mise] to manage development tools and run tasks.  You need to
install mise first, then run the following commands to set up the development
environment:

~~~~ bash
mise trust
mise install
~~~~

This will install [Deno], [Node.js], and [Bun] with the correct versions
specified in *mise.toml*.

The recommended editor for Fedify is [Visual Studio Code] with
the [Deno extension] installed.  Or you can use any editor that supports Deno;
see the [*Set Up Your Environment* section][1] in the Deno manual.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Fedify heavily depends on code generation and all packages must be built
> before coding or testing. Running `mise run install` (or `pnpm install`)
> automatically handles code generation and builds all packages.

Assuming you have Deno and Visual Studio Code installed, you can open
the repository in Visual Studio Code and get ready to hack on Fedify by running
the following commands at the *root* of the repository:

~~~~ bash
mise run install  # This runs codegen and builds all packages
code .
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to install Git pre-commit hooks after cloning the
> repository to ensure code quality checks run automatically before each
> commit:
>
> ~~~~ bash
> mise run hooks:install
> ~~~~

Note that the `mise run install` command is required to run only once at
the very first time after checkout. When you update dependencies or code
generation scripts, run `mise run install` again. Otherwise, you can skip
the command and just run:

~~~~ bash
code .
~~~~

Since this is a monorepo, you can also work on individual packages by
navigating to their directories and using package-specific tasks.

Immediately after running the `code .` command, Visual Studio Code will open
the repository, and you can start hacking on Fedify.  If you encounter the
following message:

> Do you want to install recommended ‘Deno’ extension from denoland for
> this repository?

Please click the *Install* button to install the Deno extension.

[mise]: https://mise.jdx.dev/
[Visual Studio Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/
[Deno extension]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno
[1]: https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment/

### Running the Fedify CLI

If you want to test your changes in the Fedify CLI, you can run
`mise run cli` command from the root.  For example, if you want to test
the `fedify lookup` subcommand, you can run the following command:

~~~~ bash
mise run cli -- lookup @fedify@hollo.social
~~~~

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Fedify CLI is tested with Deno, Node.js, and Bun like other packages.
> However, for quick local testing during development, `mise run cli` uses
> Deno directly without requiring a full multi-runtime test run.

#### Running the tests

If you want to test your changes in the Fedify library, you can run
the following command from the root:

~~~~ bash
mise run test:deno
~~~~

Or you can test a specific package:

~~~~ bash
deno task -f @fedify/fedify test
~~~~

You can use `--filter` option to run a specific test.  For example, if you
want to run the `verifyRequest` test:

~~~~ bash
deno task -f @fedify/fedify test --filter verifyRequest
~~~~

If the tests pass, you should run `mise run test` command to test
all packages with Deno, Node.js, and [Bun]:

~~~~ bash
mise run test
~~~~

To test individual packages with specific runtimes:

~~~~ bash
# Test with Node.js
mise run test:node

# Test with Bun
mise run test:bun
~~~~

Of course, Node.js and Bun should be installed on your system to run the tests
with Node.js and Bun.  If you followed the setup instructions above using
`mise install`, these tools are already available.

#### Testing the `init` command

If you want to test some integration packages like `@fedify/hono` or
`@fedify/denokv`, you can test them with `test:init` task.  This task runs
the `fedify init` command with various combinations of web frameworks,
package managers, KvStore implementations, and MessageQueue implementations.

~~~~ bash
mise test:init
~~~~

You can also specify specific options to test:

~~~~ bash
# Test with specific web framework and package manager
mise test:init -w hono -p deno

# Test with multiple options
mise test:init -w hono -w express -p deno -p npm -k denokv -m denokv
~~~~

If some options are not specified, all combinations are tested by default.

You can skip dry run or hydration tests:

~~~~ bash
mise test:init --no-dry-run   # Only run hydration tests
mise test:init --no-hyd-run   # Only run dry-run tests
~~~~

The test results are stored in `/tmp/fedify-init/<run-id>/`(UNIX).

> [!NOTE]
>
> The `test-init` command is for contributors only and is not exposed in the
> public CLI. It uses the `FEDIFY_TEST_MODE` environment variable internally
> to configure the init command to use local workspace packages instead of
> published versions.

#### Testing the examples

If you want to test the example projects, you can run the following command
from the root:

~~~~ bash
mise run test:examples
~~~~

This command runs the tests for all example projects.

If you want to test specific examples, you can test them by adding arguments:

~~~~ bash
mise run test:examples astro sveltekit-sample
~~~~

### Building the docs

If you want to change the Fedify docs, you would like to preview the changes
in the browser.  To do that, you need to install [Node.js] and [pnpm] first.
Then you can run the following commands at the repository root:

~~~~ bash
mise run install
mise run docs
~~~~

Once the development server is running, you can open your browser and navigate
to *http://localhost:5173/* to view the docs.

# Standalone AI policy file

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore-file -->

AI usage policy
===============

This policy is inspired by [Ghostty's AI policy][1].

The Fedify project has the following rules for AI usage:

 -  *All AI usage in any form must be disclosed.*  You must state the tool you
    used (e.g., Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) along with the extent that
    the work was AI-assisted in both your pull request description and commit
    messages.  For commit messages, use the `Assisted-by` trailer (see below
    for the required format).

 -  *Pull requests created in any way by AI can only be for accepted issues.*
    Drive-by pull requests that do not reference an accepted issue will be
    closed.  If AI isn't disclosed but a maintainer suspects its use, the PR
    will be closed.  If you want to share code for a non-accepted issue, open
    a discussion or attach it to an existing discussion.

 -  *Pull requests created by AI must have been fully verified with human use.*
    AI must not create hypothetically correct code that hasn't been tested.
    Importantly, you must not allow AI to write code for platforms or
    environments you don't have access to manually test on.

 -  *Issues and discussions can use AI assistance but must have a full
    human-in-the-loop.*  This means that any content generated with AI must
    have been reviewed and edited by a human before submission.  AI is very
    good at being overly verbose and including noise that distracts from
    the main point.  Humans must do their research and trim this down.

 -  *AI-generated media (images, diagrams, etc.) is allowed only in
    documentation, and must be clearly labeled as AI-generated.*  Text and
    code are acceptable AI-generated content per the other rules in this
    policy.  For documentation visuals like diagrams or illustrations,
    AI-generated content is permitted but must include clear attribution
    (e.g., “Diagram generated with DALL-E” or “Created using Midjourney”).

 -  *Violations of this policy may result in being banned from contributing.*
    We want to help contributors learn and grow, but repeated or intentional
    violations of this policy undermine trust and burden maintainers.

These rules apply only to outside contributions to Fedify.  Maintainers are
exempt from these rules and may use AI tools at their discretion; they've
proven themselves trustworthy to apply good judgment.

[1]: https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md


Disclosing AI assistance in commit messages
-------------------------------------------

When AI tools assist with a commit, add an `Assisted-by` trailer to the commit
message.  Do *not* use `Co-authored-by` for AI assistants; that trailer is
reserved for human co-authors.

The format is:

~~~~
Assisted-by: AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION
~~~~

For example:

~~~~
Assisted-by: OpenCode:qwen3.6-plus
Assisted-by: Claude Code:claude-sonnet-4-6
Assisted-by: Gemini CLI:gemini-3.1-pro-preview
Assisted-by: Codex:gpt-5.4
~~~~

If multiple AI tools were used, include one `Assisted-by` line per tool.


There are humans here
---------------------

Please remember that Fedify is maintained by humans.

Every discussion, issue, and pull request is read and reviewed by humans
(and sometimes machines, too).  It is a boundary point at which people interact
with each other and the work done.  It is rude and disrespectful to approach
this boundary with low-effort, unqualified work, since it puts the burden of
validation on the maintainer.

In a perfect world, AI would produce high-quality, accurate work every time.
But today, that reality depends on the driver of the AI.  And today, most
drivers of AI are just not good enough.  So, until either the people get
better, the AI gets better, or both, we have to have rules to protect
maintainers.


AI is welcome here
------------------

Fedify is written with plenty of AI assistance, and many maintainers embrace
AI tools as a productive tool in their workflow.  As a project, we welcome
AI as a tool!

*Our reason for this policy is not due to an anti-AI stance*, but instead due
to the number of highly unqualified people using AI.  It's the people, not
the tools, that are the problem.

We include this section to be transparent about the project's usage of AI for
people who may disagree with it, and to address the misconception that this
policy is anti-AI in nature.
