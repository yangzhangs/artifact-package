## How to start a contribution

The team always encourages early communication for all types of contributions. Found a bug or see something that could be improved? Open an issue. Want to address something bigger like adding new package manager support or overhauling the entire project? Open an issue or start a Discussion on Github. This way, we can give you guidance and avoid your work being wasted on an implementation which does not fit the project's scope and goal.

Alternatively, submit a pull request with one of the following

* A high-level design of the feature, highlighting goals and key decision points.
* A proof-of-concept implementation.
* In case the change is trivial, you can start with a draft or even provide a PR with the final implementation.

When working on a pull request please make sure that you have followed [pull
request guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines). For AI-assisted contributions,
make sure to comply with the [AI Contribution Policy](AI_CONTRIBUTION_POLICY.md).
Please consult [Development](#development) section, it contains a lot of helpful
information which will make contributing fast and pleasant process.

### How we deal with larger features

Implementing a larger feature (such as adding a new package manager) is usually a very long and
detailed effort. This type of work does not fit well into a single pull request; after several
comment threads it becomes almost unmanageable (for you) and very hard to review (for us). For that
reason, we request the following:

- Submit a design document that supplements the code. For new package managers, we have a
  [design template](docs/design/package-manager-template.md) that can help guide the implementation.
- New package managers should mark themselves as "experimental" by adding the `x-` prefix to its name.
- Submit small pull requests, with each one implementing a single piece of the overall feature.
  Experimental features do not need to work end to end, though these should provide warnings/errors
  for missing functionality when possible.

Note the following:

* Experimental features are not fully endorsed by the maintainers, and maintainers will not provide support.
* Experimental features are not production-ready and should never be used in production.
* Always expect that an experimental feature can be fully dropped from this project without any prior notice.
* A feature toggle is needed to allow users to opt-in. This is currently handled by prefixing the package manager name with `x-`
  (e.g.`"type": "x-foo"` instead of `"type": "foo"`).
* All SBOMs produced when an experimental feature is used will be marked as such.

If, for some reason, you feel this proposed workflow does not fit the feature you're contributing, please reach out to the maintainers so we can provide an alternative.

#### Making experimental features production-ready

When a feature's development has reached a stable point, you can propose making it an official part of the project. This signals to users that the feature is production-ready. To communicate this intent to the maintainers, open a pull request containing an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) with an outline of the implementation, and a clear statement of all decisions which were made (as well as their rationale).

Once maintainers are confident that they have enough information to maintain the new feature as officially supported they will accept it and help with moving it out from under experimental flag.

### Hermeto's Ethos

Whenever adding a new feature to Hermeto, it is important to keep these fundamental aspects in mind

1. Report prefetched dependencies as accurately as possible

    Hermeto's primary goal is to prefetch content and enable hermetic builds. But hermetic builds are only useful if they end up providing a more accurate SBOM than a non-hermetic build would. Hermeto strives to download only what's explicitly declared in a project's source code, and accurately report it in the resulting SBOM.

2. Avoid arbitrary code execution

    Some package manager implementations rely on third-party tools to gather data or even for fetching dependencies. This brings the risk of arbitrary code execution, which opens the door for random things to be part of the prefetched content. This undermines the accuracy of the SBOM, and must be avoided at all costs.

3. Always perform checksum validation

    The content provided to the build will only be safe if all of the downloaded packages have their checksums verified. In case a mismatch is found, the entire request must be failed, since the prefetched content is tainted and is potentially malicious. There are two types of checksums: server-provided and user-provided. Hermeto prefers but does not require the latter. Every dependency which does not have a user-provided checksum verified, must be clearly marked as such in the resulting SBOM (e.g. see 'pip' support). All dependencies must have at least one checksum in order to be considered validated.

4. Favor reproducibility

    Always use fully resolved lockfiles or similar input files to determine what content needs to be download for a specific project (e.g. npm's `package-lock.json`, a `pip-compile` generated `requirements.txt`, etc). Resolving the dependencies during the prefetch will prevent its behavior from being deterministic—in other words, the same repository and the same commit hash should always result in identical prefetch results.

## Development

### Virtual environment

Set up a virtual environment that has everything you will need for development:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-extras.txt
venv/bin/pip install -e .
```

This installs the Hermeto CLI in [editable mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html),
which means changes to the source code will reflect in the behavior of the CLI without the need for reinstalling.

You may need to install Python 3.10 in case you want to test your changes against Python 3.10 locally
before submitting a pull request.

```shell
dnf install python3.10
```

The CLI also depends on the following non-Python dependencies:

```shell
dnf install golang-bin git
```

### Experimental features
Use `x-<pkg>` in the request JSON to enable an experimental package manager (positional argument, not a CLI flag).
Example: `hermeto fetch-deps --source . '[{"type": "x-foo"}]'`
Please refer to other existing package managers to see how they're enabled and wired to the CLI.

From a user interface perspective, for CLI invocation, the only difference between regular and
experimental package managers is the `x-` prefix in the type name.
However experimental package managers are not fully supported which means that the functionality is
provided as a technical preview, with no stability, correctness, or backwards compatibility guarantees.
Experimental package managers must always be considered a work in progress and never be relied upon in
production.

Note: `--dev-package-managers` is deprecated (no-op) and will be removed; use `x-<pkg>`.

### Coding standards

Hermeto's codebase relies on Ruff & other code quality tools to conform to common and widely used
standards:

* [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) for formatting, import sorting, and linting
* [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for type-checking. Please include type annotations for new code.
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) to run unit tests and report coverage stats. Please aim for (near) full
  coverage of new code.

Options for all the tools are configured in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml).

Run all the checks that your pull request will be subjected to:

```shell
nox
```

### Pull request guidelines

Observe the following guidelines when submitting a pull request for review

* Write clear and informative *commit messages*. If you want to provide further context, use the PR's description
* [Sign off on](https://developercertificate.org) all commits
* Use your full name and a valid, deliverable email address for commit
  authorship. The notion of a "known identity" is open to interpretation. We simply require a real full name
  rather than a pseudonym or handle (sorry, no anonymous contributions). The same applies to the
  [DCO sign-off](https://developercertificate.org) which is required on all commits. If you set
  your `user.name` and `user.email` git configuration options, you can sign your commits
  automatically with `git commit -s`
* Please use the PR's description to provide further explanation of the pull request's title
* Split changes into multiple commits such that each commit addresses a clear and concise problem
* Avoid PRs which are too large — split the work into multiple PRs if necessary
* Amend existing commits rather than add new commits to fix issues introduced in the same pull request
* Keep your branch up-to-date using `rebase` — we don't use merge commits
* Verify the coding standards by running the configured linters
* Ensure that every single commit passes CI — this is mandatory
* Feel free to use Github comments to clarify implementation points and consider adding the same comments to the code
* Feel free to use diagrams, sample code, or links to specific parts of external documentation — they are highly encouraged
* Please respond to inline comments made in pull requests: it makes it easier to track what has been done and
  what has not and speeds up review process. "Done" is often enough to indicate that you have reacted to
  a comment
* For trivial reviewers' requests it is ok to implement it, respond with "Done" and resolve the thread.

### Error message guidelines

We try to keep error messages friendly and actionable.

* If there is a known solution, the error message should politely suggest the solution
  * Include a link to the documentation when suitable
* If there is no known solution, suggest where to look for help
* If retrying is a possible solution, suggest retrying and where to look for help if the issue persists

The error classes aim to encourage these guidelines. See the [errors.py](hermeto/core/errors.py) module.

### Comment guidelines

In general, consider adding comments to the code whenever there exists any context which is not obvious from the code alone. When writing a comment do not repeat how a piece of code works, do explain why this is needed.

If your code was inspired by any third-party sources, consider adding a comment with a link to these sources.

### Test guidelines

When extending an existing feature, please add a new test case instead of modifying any existing ones. Large test scenarios with many branching paths are very hard to understand and to maintain. It is ok to copy and paste large parts of an existing test if needed for a new scenario. It is also fine to add a new parameter group to an existing test, as long as the test function remains unchanged.

### Running unit tests

Run all unit tests (but no other checks):

```shell
nox -s python-3.10
```

For finer control over which tests get executed, e.g. to run all tests in a specific file, run:

```shell
nox -s python-3.10 -- tests/unit/test_cli.py
```

Even better, run it stepwise (exit on first failure, re-start from the failed test next time):

```shell
nox -s python-3.10 -- tests/unit/test_cli.py --stepwise
```

You can also run a single test class or a single test method:

```shell
nox -s python-3.10 -- tests/unit/test_cli.py::TestGenerateEnv
nox -s python-3.10 -- tests/unit/test_cli.py::TestGenerateEnv::test_invalid_format
nox -s python-3.10 -- tests/unit/extras/test_envfile.py::test_cannot_determine_format
```

In short, nox passes all arguments to the right of `--` directly to pytest.

#### Generating new test data

Whenever a particular package manager supported version is bumped it is considered good practice
to also re-generate the mocked unit test data using that version of package manager (make sure you
have it available in path). You do that by executing the corresponding script under
`hack/mock-unittest-data`. Note that there may be times the data has to be re-generated even
without bumping the backend version, e.g. we added support for a particular feature of the package
manager which we didn't add at the time of the initial support release.

Example:
```shell
hack/mock-unittest-data/gomod.sh
```

To generate new data (output, dependencies checksums, vendor checksums) and run integration tests with them:

```shell
nox -s generate-test-data
```

Generate data for test cases matching a pytest pattern:

```shell
nox -s generate-test-data -- -k test_e2e_gomod
```

### Running integration tests

Build Hermeto image (localhost/hermeto:latest) and run most integration tests:

```shell
nox -s integration-tests
```

Build Hermeto image (localhost/hermeto:latest) and run **all** integration tests:

```shell
nox -s all-integration-tests
```

Note: while developing, you can run the Nexus server with `tests/nexusserver/run.sh`.

To run integration-tests with custom image, specify the HERMETO\_TEST\_IMAGE environment variable or use the --hermeto-image option. Examples:

```shell
HERMETO_TEST_IMAGE=ghcr.io/hermetoproject/hermeto:{tag} nox -s integration-tests
HERMETO_TEST_IMAGE=localhost/hermeto:latest nox -s integration-tests

nox -s integration-tests -- --hermeto-image=ghcr.io/hermetoproject/hermeto:{tag}
nox -s integration-tests -- --hermeto-image=localhost/hermeto:latest
```

Another way to run integration tests is directly via `pytest`. This approach can be helpful for debugging and gives you more control over which tests are run and how they are executed. Examples:

```shell
HERMETO_TEST_IMAGE=localhost/hermeto:latest pytest [path/to/integration/test]

pytest --hermeto-image=localhost/hermeto:latest [path/to/integration/test]
```

All hermeto integration test CLI options as well as the corresponding environment variables can be listed with `pytest --help`.

To run integration tests in parallel, use the `-n` option + the number of workers. To utilize all CPU cores, use `auto` as the number of workers. Examples:

```shell
nox -s integration-tests -- -n 4
nox -s integration-tests -- -n auto

pytest [path/to/test] -n 4
pytest [path/to/test] -n auto
```

### Adding new dependencies to the project

Sometimes when working on adding a new feature you may need to add a new dependency to the project.
Usually, one commonly goes about it by adding the dependency to one of the ``requirements`` files
or the more modern and standardized ``pyproject.toml`` file.
In our case, dependencies must always be added to the ``pyproject.toml`` file as the
``requirements`` files are generated by the ``pip-compile`` tool to not only pin versions of all
dependencies but also to resolve and pin transitive dependencies. Since our ``pip-compile``
environment is tied to Python 3.10, we have a Makefile target that runs the tool in a container
image so you don't have to install another Python version locally just because of this. To
re-generate the set of dependencies, run the following in the repository and commit the changes:

```shell
nox -s pip-compile
```

### Troubleshooting

Below are common issues that you may encounter while developing your contribution to Hermeto.

#### Unable to compile `createrepo-c` wheel

In some circumstances your system may try to compile the `createrepo-c` Python wheel from source
code. Unfortunately this requires several C-headers to be present on your system, which can be
challenging to chase down.

This situation can usually be resolved in one of two ways:

1. Check if a new version of the `createrepo-c` wheel has been published. If yes, then update the
   dependency per instructions above.
2. Otherwise add the required C dependencies to your system. Below are the package names used by
   Fedora with the necessary dependencies. Note that package names may not be the same on other
   Linux distributions:
   - `bzip2-devel` (provides `bzip2` C headers)
   - `cmake`
   - `gcc` (C compiler)
   - `glib2-devel`
   - `libmodulemd-devel`
   - `libzstd-devel`
   - `ninja-build` (build tool)
   - `python3-devel` (Python development headers)
   - `rpm-devel`
   - `sqlite-devel`

On Fedora systems, these can be installed using `dnf`:

```shell
sudo dnf install -y bzip2-devel cmake gcc glib2-devel libmodulemd-devel libzstd-devel ninja-build python3-devel rpm-devel sqlite-devel
```

## Releasing

To release a new version of Hermeto, simply create a [GitHub release](https://github.com/hermetoproject/hermeto/releases).
Note that Hermeto follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.

## Release schedule

This project follows a weekly release schedule, with planned releases every Tuesday. If there is no
significant content to ship on a given release day, we may skip it. Urgent bug and security fixes
are released promptly as needed at the team’s discretion.
Should we encounter any CI issues on the day of a release, we either release immediately after the
issue is resolved or skip the release based on the nature of the changes (urgent vs regular).

# Standalone AI policy file

# AI Contribution Policy

## Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines for contributions to Hermeto that involve the
use of AI tools, including but not limited to Large Language Models (LLMs), code
generation assistants, and similar technologies. It aims to balance openness to
modern development workflows with the project's need for high-quality,
well-understood contributions.

## Position

Hermeto takes a **permissive approach** toward AI-assisted contributions. We
recognize AI tools as legitimate development aids that can improve productivity
and code quality when used responsibly.

This position is consistent with the [Linux Foundation's Generative AI
Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/generative-ai), which states that
code generated in whole or in part using AI tools can be contributed to open
source projects, **provided that licensing and intellectual property
considerations are properly addressed**.

## Contributor accountability

Regardless of AI involvement, **the contributor is fully responsible for every
aspect of their submission**. This includes correctness, security, adherence to
project standards, and licensing compliance.

Hermeto is a security-sensitive and security-oriented project: it prefetches
dependencies, validates checksums, and produces SBOMs that downstream consumers
rely on. AI-generated code that is submitted without thorough human review and
understanding poses a direct risk to its mission.

### What we expect

- **Understand your code.** You must be able to explain every line of your
    submission, defend design decisions during review, and respond to reviewer
    feedback with substance.

- **Review AI output critically.** AI tools can produce code that is
    syntactically correct, but semantically or logically flawed. Treat all AI
    output as untrusted input that requires careful validation.

- **Follow project standards.** AI-assisted contributions must meet the same
    coding standards, test coverage, and review quality as any other
    contribution. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### What we will reject

- **"Vibecoded" contributions.** Submissions that are purely AI-generated with
    minimal or no human review, understanding, or refinement will be rejected.
    If a contribution appears to be an unreviewed dump of AI output,
    maintainers may reject it without detailed feedback.

- **Contributions the author cannot explain.** If during code review a
    contributor is unable to demonstrate understanding of how their submission
    works, or cannot meaningfully address reviewer feedback, the contribution
    may be rejected regardless of code quality.

- **Autonomous AI agent submissions.** Pull requests should NOT be opened by
    AI agents independently. A human must be the author and submitter of every
    contribution. Contributors are also expected to engage directly with
    maintainers during code review, i.e. relaying chatbot responses to
    reviewer's comments is not acceptable.

## Disclosure requirements

Contributors **MUST** disclose AI tool usage when submitting code,
documentation, or other content to the project. Undisclosed AI usage discovered
during review may result in the contribution being rejected and a request to
re-submit with proper disclosure. Disclosure is done via [git commit
trailer](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers) lines. Accepted
formats include:

```text
Assisted-by: Claude
Assisted-by: Claude Code (Claude Opus 4.6)
Co-authored-by: Claude
...
```

Note these trailers must appear in addition to the required
[`Signed-off-by`](https://developercertificate.org) trailer (DCO sign-off).

### What requires disclosure

- AI wrote significant code blocks included in the submission
- AI suggested algorithms, data structures, or architectural approaches that
  were adopted
- AI generated tests, documentation, or commit messages that were used as-is or
  with minor edits
- AI-suggested solutions that materially shaped the final implementation

### What does not require disclosure

- General Q&A or learning about a technology
- IDE autocomplete or line-level completions (e.g. basic Copilot suggestions)
- Using AI to explain existing code
- Asking AI to review human-written code
- Spell checking or minor syntax corrections
- Content that was substantially rewritten to the point where the original AI
  output is unrecognizable

## Licensing considerations

Hermeto is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE).
**Contributors must ensure that:**

- **The terms of their AI tool do not impose restrictions on the generated
    output that conflict with the GPL-3.0 license**

- **AI-generated output does not contain copyrighted material from third parties
    that would violate the GPL-3.0 or the rights of the original authors**

- **They can legitimately provide a DCO sign-off for the contribution,
    certifying that they have the right to submit it under the project's
    license**

When in doubt about whether an AI tool's terms are compatible with GPL-3.0, err
on the side of caution and consult the tool's terms of service or reach out to
the maintainers.

## Review standards

Maintainers will evaluate all contributions — whether AI-assisted or not — on
the same criteria:

- Adherence to [coding standards](CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-standards) and
  [project guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines)
- Test coverage and quality (see [test guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#test-guidelines))
- Security implications (especially for dependency handling and checksum
  validation)
- Long-term maintainability
- Clarity and correctness of the implementation
