## Development Prerequisites

| Requirement    | Tested Version | Installation Instructions                                                 |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ruby           | 3.4.x or 4.0.x | [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) |
| Java           | JDK 11+        | [java.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)           |
| Docker Engine  | 27.x           | [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)                     |
| Docker Compose | 2.29.x         | [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)                    |

### Ruby

This project is written in Ruby, a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.

You may verify your `ruby` installation via the terminal:

```bash
$ ruby -v
ruby 3.4.2 (2025-02-15 revision d2930f8e7a) +PRISM [arm64-darwin24]
```

If you do not have Ruby, we recommend installing it using one of the following:

* [RVM](https://rvm.io/)
* [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)
* [rbenv](https://rbenv.org/)
* [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install)

### Ruby Dependencies

Ruby dependencies are managed using [bundler](https://bundler.io/), which comes installed with Ruby.
To install Ruby dependencies, run:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Once that is done, prefix Ruby commands (`ruby`, `rspec`, `rake`, etc) with `bundle exec` in order to run them in the context of the project bundle.

### Docker and Docker Compose

This project uses Docker Engine and Docker Compose to run Elasticsearch and OpenSearch locally. We recommend installing
[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) to get both Docker dependencies.

### Java

The test suite requires Java 11 or greater to be available on `$PATH`. You can install a modern JDK using
your package manager (i.e. `brew install java`).

## Customizing the Development Environment

The project bundle only contains the gems necessary for what runs on CI.
For local development, you may want to use some additional gems, such as:

* [debug](https://github.com/ruby/debug) for debugging
* [vernier](https://github.com/jhawthorn/vernier) for profiling
* [solargraph](https://solargraph.org/) for an LSP implementation used by an IDE

Different engineers have different preferences around what gems to include, so the standard project bundle
does not include gems like these. However, support is included to customize the development environment:

* Make a `Gemfile-custom` file listing the additional gems you want to include.
  See [Gemfile-custom.example](Gemfile-custom.example) for an example.
* Run `source script/enable_custom_gemfile`.

This will set the `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` and `BUNDLE_LOCKFILE` environment variables in your shell session
so that `bundle exec` will run in the context of your custom bundle.

## Codebase Overview

To understand how the different parts of the codebase fit together, see the [codebase overview](CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md).

## Using AI Tools

Using AI tools such as [Goose](https://goose-docs.ai/), [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/),
or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to contribute is encouraged. However:

* AI tools are assistants and should not replace critical thinking and judgement.
* We expect contributors to understand every line of code submitted in a PR--in the long run, humans are on the hook for maintaining it!

If you use an AI agent, feel free to leverage the growing [AI memory bank](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/tree/main/ai-memory),
and if updates made by your AI agent to that directory seem worth keeping, please include them in your submitted PR!

Primary agent instructions are maintained in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). We keep [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) as a compatibility symlink.

## Build Scripts and Executables

The codebase includes a variety of build scripts and executables which are useful for local development:

* `script/quick_build`: Performs an abridged version of the CI build. This is generally the most complete CI build we run locally.
  **We recommend running it before opening a PR.**
* `script/lint`: Runs the linter on the codebase, surfacing style and formatting issues.
  * Run `script/lint --fix` to autocorrect most linting issues.
* `script/type_check`: Runs a [steep](https://github.com/soutaro/steep) type check.
* `script/spellcheck`: Spellchecks the codebase using [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell).
  * Run `script/spellcheck -w` to write autocorrections back to source files.
* `script/run_specs`: Runs the test suite.
* `script/run_gem_specs [gem_name]`: Runs the test suite for one ElasticGraph gem.

### Running Tests

We use [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) as our test framework.

Each of the ElasticGraph gems has its own test suite in `spec` (e.g. `elasticgraph-support/spec` contains the tests for
`elasticgraph-support`).

Run the entire suite:

```bash
script/run_specs
```

To test a single gem (e.g., `elasticgraph-support`):

```bash
# From the root:
bundle exec rspec elasticgraph-support/spec

# Alternatively run a gem's specs within the context of that gem's bundle, with code coverage tracked:
script/run_gem_specs elasticgraph-support

# Alternatively, you can run tests within a subdirectory:
cd elasticgraph-support
bundle exec rspec
```

The RSpec CLI is extremely flexible. Here are some useful options:

```bash
# See RSpec CLI options
bundle exec rspec --help

# Run all specs in one directory
bundle exec rspec path/to/dir

# Run all specs in one file
bundle exec rspec path/to/dir/file_spec.rb

# Run the spec defined at a specific line in a file
bundle exec rspec path/to/dir/file_spec.rb:47

# Run only the tests that failed the last time they ran
bundle exec rspec --only-failures

# Run just failures, and halt after the first failure (designed to be run repeatedly)
bundle exec rspec --next-failure
```

In addition, you can run tests in parallel by using `script/flatware_rspec` instead of `bundle exec rspec`:

```bash
script/flatware_rspec path/to/dir
```

Running tests in parallel using flatware tends to be faster for large test suite runs, but is usually slower for running a
small subset of the test suite (e.g. one file or directory).

`script/quick_build`, `script/run_specs`, and `script/run_gem_specs` use flatware when appropriate. (It's not always faster!)

The integration and acceptance tests require Elasticsearch or OpenSearch to be running locally on a specific
port; to boot it for those tests, run one of the following in a separate terminal and leave it running:

```bash
bundle exec rake elasticsearch:test:boot
# or
bundle exec rake opensearch:test:boot
```

Note: our integration and acceptance tests hammer Elasticsearch/OpenSearch pretty hard, particularly when running
tests in parallel. Sometimes that puts the datastore into a bad state. When this happens, simply kill the `rake *:test:boot`
process, and run it again; then re-run the tests.

## Project Website

The source code for https://block.github.io/elasticgraph/ lives in [config/site](config/site).

To serve it locally, run:

```bash
bundle exec rake site:serve
```

Then visit http://localhost:4000/elasticgraph/ in your browser. Local edits to the site will be reflected when you reload a page.

### API Documentation

ElasticGraph's Ruby code is documented using [YARD](https://yardoc.org/). You can view the rendered API docs in the context of the
project website using the same `site:serve` rake task (just visit http://localhost:4000/elasticgraph/api-docs/main/). However, that task
fully regenerates the documentation from scratch and it's not very quick. If you're working on multiple changes to the API documentation,
you'll get a faster feedback loop using the `site:preview_docs:[gem name]` tasks. For example, to preview the docs of
[elasticgraph-schema_definition](elasticgraph-schema_definition), run:

```bash
bundle exec rake site:preview_docs:elasticgraph-schema_definition
```

Then visit http://localhost:8808/. The preview task will rebuild the parts of the generated docs impacted by your edits, and is quite fast.

## Adding a New Query API Feature

One common type of contribution to ElasticGraph is adding a new query API feature, such as a new filtering predicate or aggregation function.
This section walks through the process using the substring filtering feature (added in
[#555](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/discussions/555), [#557](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/557),
[#559](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/559), and [#560](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/560)) as an example.

### Step 1: Design and Discussion

Before implementing a new query API feature:

1. **Create a GitHub Discussion** to propose the feature and gather feedback
2. **Research the underlying datastore capabilities** (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch features)
3. **Design the GraphQL API** considering [ElasticGraph's guiding principles](https://block.github.io/elasticgraph/guides/guiding-principles/):
   - Maximize functionality while minimizing API surface area
   - Ensure query validity can be statically verified
   - Maintain consistency with existing patterns

> [!NOTE]
> What if a breaking API change is needed? We prioritize API stability and aim to avoid that as much as possible. However,
> if a breaking change unlocks the ability to offer a significant improvement, it's something we'll allow using a multi-step
> process:
>
> 1. Offer a schema definition option (e.g. `legacy_grouping_schema: true`) that lets users opt-out of the breaking change, while
>    defaulting to the new GraphQL schema (so that new projects automatically get the new-and-improved schema). As per our
>    [versioning policy](https://block.github.io/elasticgraph/guides/versioning-policy/), such a change can only go in a minor or
>    major release, not a patch release. Be sure to update the example test schema to have fields/types using both the new and old
>    schema features, so that we can maintain comprehensive test coverage of both the old and new approaches.
> 2. In the next major release (which may be much, much later), we'll plan to remove the provided legacy option. Such a removal can
>    only happen in a major release as per our versioning policy, since the upgrade may impact GraphQL clients. The release notes
>    will need to include detailed upgrade instructions. See "Remove `legacy_grouping_schema: true`" from our [v1.0.0 release
>    notes](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for an example.
>
> If you decide a breaking API change is needed, be sure to document your plans in the discussion proposing the feature.

See the [substring filtering discussion](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/discussions/555) for an example.

### Step 2: Define Schema Elements

The first implementation step is to define the new GraphQL schema elements in the schema definition DSL. For this step, the changes usually include:

* New [schema element names](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/557/files#diff-10fb8f31c5a5f5ebf0a391f657092c0b71c22a4e57d68357351420f2bda66922)
  for any new fields or arguments. The `SchemaElementNames` class allows ElasticGraph users to customize the names used in the generated GraphQL schema.
  For example, in this case, it would allow a user to name the new prefix filtering predicate `beginsWith` instead of `startsWith`.
* New [built-in types](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/557/files#diff-7c9b0d43e7f3a56832eb9dbb7388b2c99861e84d63113fe7c992133c50c05f4d) or updates
  to existing built-in types to expose the new functionality. Be sure to include documentation on any new types or fields.
* [Test coverage](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/557/files#diff-a231c0a4083d375901ca2becb92428b88013a43f2c7df737935799910742a31a)
  of the new GraphQL schema elements.
* [Artifact updates](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/557/files#diff-5185e837ecb7d102d3a047e802db34381560388ffa5e90d8ca0b47bdc8175426) for
  the local/test schema used in this repo. The artifacts can be updated by running `bundle exec rake schema_artifacts:dump`.

See the [substring schema definition PR](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/557) for a complete example.

### Step 3: Implement Query Translation

Next, implement the logic to translate from GraphQL to the appropriate datastore query form. For this step, the changes usually include:

* Updates to the core query engine logic. The place to make changes depends on what kind of functionality you're adding:
  * Changes may need to be made to [ElasticGraph::GraphQL::DatastoreQuery](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/blob/main/elasticgraph-graphql/lib/elastic_graph/graphql/datastore_query.rb),
    which is the intermediate form used by ElasticGraph internally to model an OpenSearch/Elasticsearch query.
  * For a new filtering predicate, add a new entry to the map of filter operators in
    [filter_node_interpreter.rb](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/559/files#diff-59bf7147ee82aa3a9d418645c86652be6e1318cd1a9a190697c2944f03e9a454).
  * For a new aggregation feature, multiple changes are typically needed under the
    [ElasticGraph::GraphQL::Aggregation](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/tree/main/elasticgraph-graphql/lib/elastic_graph/graphql/aggregation) module:
    * [ElasticGraph::GraphQL::Aggregation::Query](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/blob/main/elasticgraph-graphql/lib/elastic_graph/graphql/aggregation/query.rb)
      models an aggregation query.
    * [ElasticGraph::GraphQL:::Aggregation::QueryAdapter](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/blob/main/elasticgraph-graphql/lib/elastic_graph/graphql/aggregation/query_adapter.rb)
      is responsible for building an `ElasticGraph::GraphQL::Aggregation::Query` from the GraphQL query AST.
    * The [ElasticGraph::GraphQL::Aggregation::Resolvers module](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/tree/main/elasticgraph-graphql/lib/elastic_graph/graphql/aggregation/resolvers)
      is responsible for resolving GraphQL aggregation fields by extracting values from the datastore response.
* Multiple levels of comprehensive test coverage:
  * The [acceptance tests](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/559/files#diff-2635a27e95de68f2fec3cb6a23215484017065820183c89a404b867b1ee1271e) exercise the new
    GraphQL feature end-to-end, and are the ultimate demonstration that your new feature works. We intentionally do _not_ follow a "one assertion per test" rule with
    these tests; instead, we optimize for test speed by running multiple GraphQL queries after indexing some documents.
  * The [integration tests](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/559/files#diff-131e35b788a101aa59a75c26be5fc7e979c475cf19348ef6f15f3c58f629fffe)
    still hit the datastore "for real", but do not exercise the GraphQL layer. Instead, these tests directly build and execute a `DatastoreQuery`.
  * The [unit tests](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/559/files#diff-de5c6b5a9cff3c7202554ee120716d0ba795dc26cb77f4db7ad9e0192ea52f48) also directly
    build a `DatastoreQuery`. However, instead of executing the `DatastoreQuery`, we inspect the body of the produced query to verify it is correct.
* For new filtering predicates, be sure to consider what impact your change may have on [shard
  routing](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/blob/main/elasticgraph-graphql/spec/unit/elastic_graph/graphql/datastore_query/shard_routing_spec.rb)
  and [search index expressions](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/blob/main/elasticgraph-graphql/spec/unit/elastic_graph/graphql/datastore_query/search_index_expression_spec.rb).
  Otherwise, the queries may target the wrong shards or indices!

See the [substring query translation PR](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/559) for a complete example.

### Step 4: Update Documentation

Finally, add user-facing documentation to the ElasticGraph website to help users understand and use the new feature. This could take
the form of a brand new page and/or updates to an existing page. As you work on the updates, run the following so you can view the site
locally in your browser (at http://localhost:4000/elasticgraph/):

```bash
bundle exec rake site:serve
```

We aim to include working examples throughout our docs, so please add one or more example queries demonstrating usage of the new feature.
[Example GraphQL queries](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/560/files#diff-a55ad82ae9cb900fad024d36947c6d00dd2a5e270ff011bfc12a25b6e839ce7a)
are defined under `config/site/examples/*/queries` and then [included in a documentation
page](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/560/files#diff-af80e36cdc284bb4861e26b2d1854c8d4c94d827e1634163038501803f344c55)
using `{% include copyable_code_snippet.html language="graphql" data="..." %}`.

All example queries are validated as part of the CI build against the example schema provided by `elasticgraph new` when
bootstrapping a project, to verify that they return no errors and return some data. To try an example query out locally, run:

```bash
ELASTICGRAPH_GEMS_PATH=`pwd` bundle exec elasticgraph new tmp/demo_app
cd tmp/demo_app
bundle exec rake boot_locally
```

You may need to update the schema or factories provided in [the project template](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/tree/main/elasticgraph/lib/elastic_graph/project_template)
so that the new query feature is available and produces matching results.

See the [substring documentation PR](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/pull/560) for a complete example.

## Maintenance Tasks

Common codebase maintenance tasks are documented in the [maintainer's runbook](MAINTAINERS_RUNBOOK.md).

## Communications

### Issues

Anyone from the community is welcome (and encouraged!) to raise issues via
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/issues).

### Discussions

Design discussions and proposals take place on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/discussions).
We advocate an asynchronous, written discussion model - so write up your thoughts and invite the community to join in!

In addition, we have a discord channel (`#elasticgraph`) on the [Block Open Source Discord server](https://discord.gg/block-opensource)
for synchronous communication. Discord is best for questions and general conversation.

### Continuous Integration

Build and test cycles are run on every commit to every branch on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/actions).

## Contribution

We review contributions to the codebase via GitHub's Pull Request mechanism. We have
the following guidelines to ease your experience and help our leads respond quickly
to your valuable work:

* Start by proposing a change either on Discord (most appropriate for small
  change requests or bug fixes) or in Discussions (most appropriate for design
  and architecture considerations, proposing a new feature, or where you'd
  like insight and feedback).
* Cultivate consensus around your ideas; the project leads will help you
  pre-flight how beneficial the proposal might be to the project. Developing early
  buy-in will help others understand what you're looking to do, and give you a
  greater chance of your contributions making it into the codebase! No one wants to
  see work done in an area that's unlikely to be incorporated into the codebase.
* Fork the repo into your own namespace/remote.
* Work in a dedicated feature branch. Atlassian wrote a great
  [description of this workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
* When you're ready to submit a pull request:
    * Squash your commits into a single one (or an appropriate small number of commits), and
      rebase atop the upstream `main` branch. This will limit the potential for merge
      conflicts during review, and helps keep the audit trail clean. A good writeup for
      how this is done is
      [here](https://medium.com/@slamflipstrom/a-beginners-guide-to-squashing-commits-with-git-rebase-8185cf6e62ec), and if you're
      having trouble - feel free to ask a member or the community for help or leave the commits as-is, and flag that you'd like
      rebasing assistance in your PR! We're here to support you.
    * Please run `script/quick_build` and fix any failures (it'll be faster to get your change merged if it already passes the build!)
      * If you're not sure how to fix the failures (and an AI agent isn't helping), feel free to submit what you have and we'll
        recommend the fix.
    * Open a PR in the project to bring in the code from your feature branch.
    * The maintainers noted in the [CODEOWNERS file](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS)
      will review your PR and optionally open a discussion about its contents before moving forward.
    * Remain responsive to follow-up questions, be open to making requested changes, and...
      You're a contributor!
* Remember to respect everyone in our development community. Guidelines
  are established in our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/block/elasticgraph/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
