## Development

### Prerequisites

This project uses several tools for development. Most tools will be automatically installed when you first run the corresponding `make` target. However, you need to have:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.25 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Make (usually pre-installed on macOS and Linux)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation
   cd opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```sh
   make build
   ```

3. Run tests:

   ```sh
   make test
   ```

### Available Make Targets

Run `make help` to see all available targets:

```sh
make help
```

#### Build Targets

- `make build` - Build the instrumentation tool (includes packaging)
- `make install` - Install the `otelc` binary to `$GOPATH/bin`
- `make package` - Package the instrumentation code into a binary archive
- `make build-demo-grpc` - Build gRPC demo server and client

#### Code Quality

- `make format` - Format all code (Go + YAML + License Headers)
  - `make format/go` - Format Go code only using golangci-lint
  - `make format/yaml` - Format YAML files only using yamlfmt
  - `make format/license` - Apply license headers to Go files
- `make lint` - Run all linters (Go, YAML, GitHub Actions, Makefile)
  - `make lint/go` - Run golangci-lint on Go code
  - `make lint/yaml` - Lint YAML formatting
  - `make lint/action` - Lint GitHub Actions workflows
  - `make lint/makefile` - Lint Makefile
  - `make lint/license` - Check license headers (has dedicated CI workflow)

#### License Headers

All Go files must include the proper license header. The license header configuration is defined in `license.yml` which handles exclusions for vendor directories, temporary files, and generated code.

To check and fix license headers:

- **Check license headers**: `make lint/license`
- **Apply license headers**: `make format/license`

The license header checker has a dedicated CI workflow (`check-license-headers.yaml`) that runs automatically on pull requests and pushes when Go files or the license configuration change.

#### Testing

- `make test` - Run all tests (unit + integration)
- `make test-unit` - Run unit tests only with formatted output
- `make test-integration` - Run integration tests only with formatted output
- `make test-e2e` - Run end-to-end tests

Test results are saved to `gotest-unit.log` and `gotest-integration.log` for review.

#### Documentation

- `make docs` - Update embedded documentation in markdown files

#### Semantic Conventions

- `make weaver-install` - Install OTel Weaver if not present
- `make lint/semantic-conventions` - Validate semantic convention registry
- `make registry-diff` - Generate diff between two versions of semantic convention registry
- `make semantic-conventions/resolve` - Resolve semantic convention registry schema

For detailed information on managing semantic conventions, see [docs/semantic-conventions.md](docs/semantic-conventions.md).

#### GitHub Actions Security

- `make ratchet/pin` - Pin GitHub Actions to specific commit SHAs for security
- `make ratchet/update` - Update pinned GitHub Actions to latest versions
- `make ratchet/check` - Verify all GitHub Actions are properly pinned

#### Cleanup

- `make clean` - Remove all build artifacts and temporary files

### Development Workflow

A typical development workflow looks like:

1. Make your changes
2. Format your code: `make format`
3. Run linters: `make lint`
4. Run tests: `make test`
5. Commit your changes

For a complete check before submitting a PR, run:

```sh
make all
```

This will run: `build`, `format`, `lint`, and `test` in sequence.

### Tools

The following development tools are used and will be automatically installed on first use:

- **[golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/)** - Go linter aggregator
- **[gotestfmt](https://github.com/gotesttools/gotestfmt)** - Prettier test output
- **[yamlfmt](https://github.com/google/yamlfmt)** - YAML formatter
- **[actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint)** - GitHub Actions linter
- **[ratchet](https://github.com/sethvargo/ratchet)** - GitHub Actions security pinning
- **[embedmd](https://github.com/campoy/embedmd)** - Embed code in markdown files

### Architecture Decision Records

Significant architectural decisions are documented as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/). Read them to understand *why* the project is structured the way it is.

Create a new ADR when proposing:

- Changes to the instrumentation API or hook model
- New external dependencies or replacements
- Changes to the two-phase build process
- Any decision the SIG discusses and reaches consensus on

To create a new ADR:

```sh
make adr-new TITLE="Title of Your Decision"
```

This requires `adr-tools` (`npryce/adr-tools`). Run `make adr-tools` to install it. To list existing ADRs:

```sh
make adr-list
```

## AI Usage

This project welcomes the use of AI tools. Please read the [AI Usage Policy](AI_POLICY.md) before
contributing. The critical rule is: **you must understand every line of code you submit.**
Contributors using AI tools are held to the same quality standards as any other contribution.


## Pull Requests

### Conventional Commits

Pull requests made to this repository are expected to use the [Conventional Commits][conv-commit]
specification. Specifically, pull request titles are required to follow the specification's title
format:

```
<type>(<scope>)!: <description>
╰─┬──╯╰───┬───╯│  ╰─────┬─────╯
  │       │    │        ╰─ Short description of the change (see below)
  │       │    ╰─ If, and only if the PR contains breaking changes
  │       ╰─ Optional: change scope (e.g, 'cmd/gotel', `pkg/weaver`, ...)
  ╰─ Required: commit type (see below for accepted values)
```

This repository requires using one of the following commit types:

- `chore` for routine repository maintenance that has no impact on the user interfaces (CI/CD
  operations, linter configuration, etc...)
- `doc` or `docs` for documentation changes
- `feat` for introduction of new features
- `fix` for bug fixes
- `release` when cutting a new release
- `refactor` for code changes that do not add new features or fix bugs

Please try to keep the commit title concise, yet specific: they are used to derive the release notes
for this repository. A good litmus test for whether a pull request title is suitable or not is to
determine whether a user would be able to determine whether this change affects them or not by just
looking at the title.

Here are some examples for the various supported commit types:

- `chore`:
  - :information_source: What's changing in this PR? This should provide enough information from a
    maintainer to make sense of what's going on.
  - :white_check_mark: `chore(ci): add OSSF Scorecard automation`
  - :x: `chore: new CI step`
- `doc`, `docs`:
  - :information_source: What documentation has change? A user might decide whether they go read it
    or not based on this.
  - :white_check_mark: `docs: explain proper use of the -log-level flag`
  - :x: `docs: improve documentation`
- `feat`:
  - :information_source:  What feature is being introduced specifically? A user might decide if this
    is useful to them or not based on this.
  - :white_check_mark: `feat(cmd/gotel): -log-level flag to configure log verbosity`
  - :x: `feat: logging`
- `fix`:
  - :information_source: What bug is being fixed? Refer to the symptoms of the fixed issue, not to
    the solution. A user might decide whether their problem is solved by a release or not based on
    this.
  - :white_check_mark: `fix: SEGFAULT on when cross-compiling on linux/arm64 platforms`
  - :x: `fix: check pointer for nil before dereferencing it`
- `release`:
  - :information_source: What version is this commit preparing for?
  - :white_check_mark: `release: v1.2.3`
  - :x: `release: new release`
- `refactor`:
  - :information_source: What code is being refactored?
  - :white_check_mark: `refactor: remove unused code`
  - :x: `refactor: improve code readability`

### How to Send Pull Requests

Everyone is welcome to contribute code to `opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation` via
GitHub pull requests (PRs).

To create a new PR, fork the project in GitHub and clone the upstream
repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation
```

This would put the project in the `opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation` directory in
current working directory.

Enter the newly created directory and add your fork as a new remote:

```sh
git remote add <YOUR_FORK> git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation
```

Check out a new branch, make modifications, run linters and tests, update
`CHANGELOG.md`, and push the branch to your fork:

```sh
git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
# edit files
# update changelog
git add -p
git commit
git push <YOUR_FORK> <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
```

Open a pull request against the main `opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation` repo.
Be sure to add the pull request ID to the entry you added to `CHANGELOG.md`.

Avoid rebasing and force-pushing to your branch to facilitate reviewing the pull request.
Rewriting Git history makes it difficult to keep track of iterations during code review.
All pull requests are squashed to a single commit upon merge to `main`.

### How to Receive Comments

- If the PR is not ready for review, please put `[WIP]` in the title,
  tag it as `work-in-progress`, or mark it as
  [`draft`](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
- Make sure CLA is signed and CI is clear.

### How to Get PRs Merged

A PR is considered **ready to merge** when:

- It has received two qualified approvals[^1].

  This is not enforced through automation, but needs to be validated by the
  maintainer merging.
  - The qualified approvals need to be from [Approver]s/[Maintainer]s
    affiliated with different companies. Two qualified approvals from
    [Approver]s or [Maintainer]s affiliated with the same company counts as a
    single qualified approval.
  - PRs introducing changes that have already been discussed and consensus
    reached only need one qualified approval. The discussion and resolution
    needs to be linked to the PR.
  - Trivial changes[^2] only need one qualified approval.

- All feedback has been addressed.
  - All PR comments and suggestions are resolved.
  - All GitHub Pull Request reviews with a status of "Request changes" have
    been addressed. Another review by the objecting reviewer with a different
    status can be submitted to clear the original review, or the review can be
    dismissed by a [Maintainer] when the issues from the original review have
    been addressed.
  - Any comments or reviews that cannot be resolved between the PR author and
    reviewers can be submitted to the community [Approver]s and [Maintainer]s
    during the weekly SIG meeting. If consensus is reached among the
    [Approver]s and [Maintainer]s during the SIG meeting the objections to the
    PR may be dismissed or resolved or the PR closed by a [Maintainer].
  - Any substantive changes to the PR require existing Approval reviews be
    cleared unless the approver explicitly states that their approval persists
    across changes. This includes changes resulting from other feedback.
    [Approver]s and [Maintainer]s can help in clearing reviews and they should
    be consulted if there are any questions.

- The PR branch is up to date with the base branch it is merging into.
  - To ensure this does not block the PR, it should be configured to allow
    maintainers to update it.

- It has been open for review for at least one working day. This gives people
  reasonable time to review.
  - Trivial changes[^2] do not have to wait for one day and may be merged with
    a single [Maintainer]'s approval.

- All required GitHub workflows have succeeded.
- Urgent fix can take exception as long as it has been actively communicated
  among [Maintainer]s.

Any [Maintainer] can merge the PR once the above criteria have been met.

[^1]: A qualified approval is a GitHub Pull Request review with "Approve"
  status from an OpenTelemetry Go Compile Instrumentation [Approver] or [Maintainer].
[^2]: Trivial changes include: typo corrections, cosmetic non-substantive
  changes, documentation corrections or updates, dependency updates, etc.

# Standalone AI policy file

# AI Usage Policy

This project follows the [OpenTelemetry Generative AI Contribution Policy][otel-genai-policy].
Read and understand that document first — it is the canonical reference for all OpenTelemetry
repositories.

The sections below add project-specific guidance for `opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation`.

## The Critical Rule

**You must understand every line of code you submit.**

If you cannot explain what your changes do and how they interact with the broader system without
the aid of AI tools, do not contribute those changes. Using AI to write code is fine. Submitting
AI-generated output that has not been understood, reviewed, and owned by a human is not.

The fundamentals of software engineering have not changed. We still need carefully structured,
readable, and maintainable code backed by good tests. The quality of any contribution depends on
the quality of the thinking behind it, not the tool used to write it.

## Interactions on GitHub

Issue comments, pull request reviews, and any other communication on this repository are for
humans only. Never post AI-generated content directly to issues, PRs, or discussions without
thorough human review and editing. The content must be your own words, even if AI helped you draft
them.

AI code review tools configured by the repository maintainers (e.g. GitHub Copilot code review) are
an exception — those are expected and welcome.
