# Welcome to the RustCast contributing guide!

Thank you for wanting to contribute to RustCast!

There are 2 areas you can work on:

1. Bug fixes
1. New Features
1. Help people in solving their github issues

For bug fixes, and helping people to solve their github issues: see
[https://github.com/RustCastLabs/rustcast/issues] For features, see
[The Planned Features in the README](README.md) or
[The existing feature list](FEATURES.md)

## Code Guidelines:

1. All code must be formatted with `cargo fmt`
1. Code must not be malicious or be intended to harm someones device
1. All features added must work as intended
1. Code must compile...
1. No AI Slop. AI Usage is allowed, but please limit it and ensure its a human
   writing the descriptions and minimally ~75% of the code
1. A video recording / screenshot would be an added bonus in getting your pull
   request merged faster.
