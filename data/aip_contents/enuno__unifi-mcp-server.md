## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that promotes a welcoming and inclusive environment. All contributors are expected to:

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the project and community
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `uv` for Python package and virtual environment management
- Git for version control
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- A UniFi Network Controller for testing (can be a local instance or cloud-hosted)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unifi-mcp-server.git
cd unifi-mcp-server
```

3. Add the upstream repository as a remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/elvis/unifi-mcp-server.git
```

## Development Setup

### 1. Install uv

If you haven't already installed `uv`, follow the instructions at [https://github.com/astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

### 2. Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the project with development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 3. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality and consistency before commits:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

### 4. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file for local development:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Obtain Your UniFi API Key

Before configuring the environment, you need to obtain an API key:

1. Log in to [UniFi Site Manager](https://unifi.ui.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings → Control Plane → Integrations**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. **Copy and save the key immediately** - it's only shown once!

#### Configure Your Environment

Edit the `.env` file with your UniFi API key:

```env
# Required: Your UniFi API Key
UNIFI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# For cloud API (recommended)
UNIFI_API_TYPE=cloud
UNIFI_HOST=api.ui.com
UNIFI_PORT=443
UNIFI_VERIFY_SSL=true

# OR for local gateway proxy
# UNIFI_API_TYPE=local
# UNIFI_HOST=192.168.2.1
# UNIFI_VERIFY_SSL=false
```

**CRITICAL SECURITY NOTES:**

- **NEVER commit the `.env` file** to version control (it's in `.gitignore`)
- **API keys provide full access** to your UniFi environment - treat them like passwords
- **Store keys securely** using environment variables or secret management systems
- **Rotate keys regularly** for security best practices
- **Monitor key usage** for suspicious activity
- The API is currently **read-only** in Early Access, but will support write operations in future versions

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - The main branch contains stable, production-ready code
- `feature/*` - Feature branches for new functionality
- `fix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `docs/*` - Documentation-only changes
- `refactor/*` - Code refactoring that doesn't change functionality

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Write or update tests as necessary
3. Update documentation if you're changing functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass: `pytest`
5. Ensure code passes linting: `pre-commit run --all-files`

## Code Style Guidelines

This project follows strict code style guidelines enforced by automated tools:

### Python Style

- **Formatting:** Code is formatted with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) (line length: 100)
- **Import Sorting:** Imports are sorted with [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) (compatible with Black)
- **Linting:** Code is linted with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
- **Type Checking:** Type hints are required and checked with [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/)

### Key Conventions

- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Prefer `async` functions for I/O-bound operations
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all public functions, classes, and modules
- Maximum line length: 100 characters (enforced by Black)

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional
import httpx
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Device(BaseModel):
    """Represents a UniFi network device."""

    mac: str
    name: str
    model: str
    ip: Optional[str] = None


async def get_devices(
    client: httpx.AsyncClient, site_id: str = "default"
) -> List[Device]:
    """
    Retrieve all devices for a specific site.

    Args:
        client: Authenticated HTTP client
        site_id: Site identifier (default: "default")

    Returns:
        List of Device objects

    Raises:
        httpx.HTTPError: If the API request fails
    """
    response = await client.get(f"/api/s/{site_id}/stat/device")
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()
    return [Device(**device) for device in data["data"]]
```

## Commit Message Conventions

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- `ci`: Changes to CI/CD configuration

### Examples

```
feat(api): add support for firewall rule management

Implement MCP tools for creating, updating, and deleting
UniFi firewall rules through the official API.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(auth): handle session timeout gracefully

Previously, the server would crash when the UniFi session
expired. Now it automatically re-authenticates.
```

## Automated Workflows

### Bug Report Handler

The repository includes an automated bug report handler that activates when issues are created with `[Bug]` in the title:

**How It Works:**

1. **Automatic Trigger:** The workflow activates when a new issue is opened with `[Bug]` in the title
2. **Intelligent Analysis:** Claude AI analyzes the bug report to determine if it's:
   - A real bug that needs fixing
   - A usage misunderstanding that needs clarification
   - A duplicate of an existing issue

3. **Automated Actions:**
   - **For Usage Issues:** Posts helpful comments with correct usage examples, references documentation, and may close the issue with explanation
   - **For Real Bugs:** Attempts to reproduce and fix the bug, creates a PR with tests if successful
   - **For Complex Bugs:** Acknowledges the issue, adds appropriate labels, and tags maintainers

**What to Expect:**

- The workflow typically responds within a few minutes
- It will add appropriate labels (bug, documentation, needs-investigation, etc.)
- It may create a pull request if the bug can be automatically fixed
- It will always provide helpful feedback to the issue reporter

**Best Practices for Bug Reports:**

To get the most helpful automated response:

- Use the bug report template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`)
- Include complete error messages and stack traces
- Specify your environment (API mode, UniFi version, Python version)
- Describe steps to reproduce the issue
- Indicate what you expected vs. what actually happened

**Manual Override:**

If you believe the automated response is incorrect, simply comment on the issue and a human maintainer will review it.

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

All new code must include unit tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_api.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
pytest -k "test_authentication"
```

### Test Coverage

- Minimum code coverage: 80%
- New features must include tests that cover all code paths
- Bug fixes should include regression tests

### Integration Tests

Integration tests that interact with a real UniFi controller should be marked:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_real_controller_connection():
    # Test code here
    pass
```

Run integration tests separately:

```bash
pytest -m integration
```

### MCP Inspector Testing

Use the MCP Inspector to manually test tools and resources:

```bash
uv run mcp dev src/main.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- All public functions, classes, and modules must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def function(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of function.

    Longer description if needed.

    Args:
        arg1: Description of arg1
        arg2: Description of arg2

    Returns:
        Description of return value

    Raises:
        ValueError: When something is wrong
    """
    pass
```

### Project Documentation

- Update `README.md` for user-facing changes
- Update `API.md` for new MCP tools or resources
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` (if exists) with notable changes
- Add examples for new features
