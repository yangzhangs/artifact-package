## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 22.1.0
- **FoundryVTT** running locally (for development)
- **Git** for version control

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nimble-Co/FoundryVTT-Nimble.git
   cd FoundryVTT-Nimble
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This will start a Vite development server on `http://localhost:30001` that proxies to your local FoundryVTT instance running on port 30000.

4. **Configure FoundryVTT:**
   - Ensure FoundryVTT is running on `http://localhost:30000`
   - The development server will automatically proxy requests to your FoundryVTT instance
   - The system will be available at `/systems/nimble/` in your FoundryVTT installation

### Build Commands

- **`pnpm build:system`** - Build only the system files
- **`pnpm build:compendia`** - Build only the compendia data

- **`pnpm lint`** - Lint code with Biome
- **`pnpm lint-fix`** - Auto-fix linting issues
- **`pnpm type-check`** - Run TypeScript type checking
- **`pnpm check`** - Run all checks (format, lint, circular dependencies, type-check, tests)

## 🔧 Key Files

### Core System Files

- **[`src/nimble.ts`](src/nimble.ts)** - Main entry point that registers all hooks and initializes the system
- **[`src/config.ts`](src/config.ts)** - System configuration including ability scores, damage types, classes, and game constants
- **[`src/hooks/init.ts`](src/hooks/init.ts)** - System initialization hook that registers document classes, sheets, and data models
- **[`src/game.ts`](src/game.ts)** - Game instance setup and global utilities

### Build Configuration

- **[`vite.config.mts`](vite.config.mts)** - Vite configuration with FoundryVTT proxy setup
- **[`svelte.config.js`](svelte.config.js)** - Svelte preprocessor configuration
- **[`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json)** - TypeScript configuration with FoundryVTT types

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Ensure you're on the `dev` branch: `git checkout dev`
3. Create a feature branch from `dev`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
4. Make your changes and ensure tests pass
5. Run checks before committing: `pnpm check`
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
7. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
8. Submit a pull request **against the `dev` branch**

> **Note:** All development work should branch from `dev` and all pull requests should target `dev`. The `main` branch is reserved for releases.

### Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Run `pnpm check` before committing (formats, lints, checks for circular dependencies, type-checks, and runs tests)
- Test your changes in FoundryVTT
- Update documentation as needed

### Community & Communication

**Join our Discord server before contributing:** [Nimble FoundryVTT System](https://discord.gg/SxVmHpu34R)

We encourage all contributors to join the Discord and discuss changes before submitting large or architectural PRs. This helps ensure alignment with project direction and prevents wasted effort.

### Pull Request Guidelines

**PRs that will be rejected:**

- **Overly large PRs without prior discussion** - If your PR touches many files or introduces significant new functionality, please discuss it on Discord first. Breaking changes into smaller, reviewable PRs is preferred.
- **Complex infrastructure changes** - PRs introducing Docker setups, Playwright automation, CI/CD changes, or other infrastructure without prior team consultation will be closed.
- **AI-generated bulk changes** - Large PRs that appear to be AI-generated without human review or curation are difficult to review and will be rejected. This includes bulk additions of configuration files, automated testing suites, or agent-style setups.
- **Security risks** - PRs containing potential security vulnerabilities, including prompt injection risks in configuration files, will not be merged.

**Best practices:**

- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Provide clear descriptions of what your PR does and why
- If using AI tools to assist with code, review and understand all changes before submitting
- For significant features or architectural changes, open an issue or discuss on Discord first

## 📦 Deployment

1. Build the system: `pnpm build`
2. Copy the `dist/` folder to your FoundryVTT `systems/nimble/` directory
3. Restart FoundryVTT or reload the system
