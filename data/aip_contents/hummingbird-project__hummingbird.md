## Legal
By submitting a pull request, you represent that you have the right to license your contribution to the community, and agree by submitting the patch
that your contributions are licensed under the Apache 2.0 license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

## Contributor Conduct
All contributors are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submitting a bug or issue
Please ensure to include the following in your bug report
- A consise description of the issue, what happened and what you expected.
- Simple reproduction steps
- Version of the library you are using
- Contextual information (Swift version, OS etc)

## Adding a Feature
Prior to adding features please discuss the feature request in an issue and/or on our Discord server. That way we can shape the new feature together, make it fit the project, and validate it's within our vision of the framework.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Please ensure to include the following in your Pull Request
- A link referencing the issue (bug or feature request) it fixes
- A description of the code changes
- Documentation on how these changes are being tested
- Additional tests to show your code working and to ensure future changes don't break your code.

Please keep your PRs to a minimal number of changes. This helps us review and merge them in a timely fashion. If a PR is large try to split it up into smaller PRs. Don't move code around unnecessarily as it makes comparing old with new very hard.

The main development branch of the repository is  `main`.

### Formatting

We use Apple's swift-format for formatting code. PRs will not be accepted if they haven't be formatted.

### Usage of AI Tools

We have a separate [AI_POLICY.md](AI_POLICY.md) document. If you are using AI assistance you should read this.

# AI Policy

As AI assisted coding is becoming more prevalent in open source code projects, it is necessary we have a policy about Al usage in contributions to Hummingbird and its related projects. 

We are happy to accept contributions that have been generated using some form of AI assistance with the following provisos.
- Contributors should have fully reviewed any generated code, understand it, able to answer questions about it and be able to explain the rationale behind decisions made. The contributor is always the author and is fully accountable for their contributions. 
- Contributors should have the right to license their submissions to the project as detailed in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). 
- It should be made clear if a considerable amount of a pull request has been generated. For instance by adding “Assisted-by:” to commit messages.
- The quality bar for pull requests is the same regardless of whether they have been generated with AI or not. We expect PRs to compile on all supported platforms, tests to be added where applicable.
- Any non-code submission eg Issues, PR descriptions or security reports should not be generated using AI, with the exception of fixing grammar and spelling. 
- There should always be a human in the loop. Agents cannot be used to respond with PR comments, feedback or commits. All responses have to be reviewed by a human before submission.
- Finally AI cannot be used to implement good first issues. These are designed for someone to learn the code base and using an AI assistant is defeating the purpose of them.  

Much of this policy was inspired by the [LLVM Project AI Tool Use Policy](https://llvm.org/docs/AIToolPolicy.html)
