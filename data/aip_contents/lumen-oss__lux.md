# Contributing guide

Contributions are more than welcome!

We label issues that we think should be easy for first-time contributors
with [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/lumen-oss/lux/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22).

This document assumes that you already know how to use GitHub and Git.
If that's not the case, we recommend [learning about it first here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

## Strict No LLM / No AI Policy

## CI

Our CI checks are run using [`nix`](https://nixos.org/download.html#download-nix).

## Development

You don't have to use `nix`.
But we recommend it, because it is easier to reproduce CI build/test failures
and our [nix dev shell](#nix-dev-shell) provides everything you need
to build Lux out of the box.

### Dev environment

See [README.md/Building from source](./README.md#wrench-building-from-source)
for build dependencies.
We use the following tools:

#### Formatting

- [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) [Rust]
- [`alejandra`](https://github.com/kamadorueda/alejandra) [Nix]

#### Linting

- [`cargo check`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-check.html)
- [`clippy`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/)

### Nix dev shell

- Requires [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) to be enabled.

For Nix users, we provide a `devShell` that can bootstrap
everything needed to build, format and lint Lux.

To enter a development shell:

```console
nix develop
```

To apply formatting and run linters, run

```console
nix fmt
```

Optionally, you can use [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) to auto-load
the development shell. Just run `direnv allow`.

### Testing

We value proof of functionality in the form of automated tests.
For that, we rely on

- Unit/property tests, in a `tests` submodule of the respective modules to be tested.
- Integration tests: Modules in a `tests` directory.

We recommend [test driven development](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html),
but that is up to you.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Impure unit tests that require a network connection cannot be built with Nix.
> So we try to avoid them if possible (this is not the case for integration tests,
> which we don't run with Nix).
> If a unit test absolutely needs a network connection, please make sure to skip
> it if the `LUX_SKIP_IMPURE_TESTS` environment variable is set to 1.

#### Running tests without nix

For reproducibility, we only run tests that can be sandboxed with `nix`,
skipping integration tests and impure tests that need a network connection.

Running `cargo test` locally will run all tests, including integration tests.

Or, if you are using [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/), we provide an alias:

```bash
cargo tt
```

#### Running tests and checks with Nix

If you just want to run all checks that are available, run:

```console
nix flake check -Lv
```

To run individual checks, using Nix:

```console
nix build .#checks.<your-system>.<check> -Lv
```

For example:

```console
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.tests -Lv
```

For formatting and linting:

```console
nix build .#checks.<your-system>.git-hooks-check -Lv
```

#### Testing Lux manually

For convenience, we provide a `cargo lx` alias,
which will build Lux in debug mode and invoke its CLI with any arguments
you pass to it.

Example:

```conseole
cargo lx --help
```
