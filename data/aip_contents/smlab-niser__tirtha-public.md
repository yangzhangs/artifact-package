## Ways to Contribute

You can help Project Tirtha in many ways:

- [As a coder](#contributing-as-a-coder):
  - backend pipelines, frontend UI/UX, Bug reports, and fixes
  - research ideas, RFCs, and design discussions
- [As a Non-coder](#contributing-as-a-non-coder):
  - dataset curation and metadata improvements
  - outreach, community building, and partnerships

No contribution is too small.

Before you start, please read the relevant sections below, specifically the [LLM / AI Tool Usage Policy](#llm--ai-tool-usage-policy) and [Communication](#communication) guidelines.

---

## LLM / AI Tool Usage Policy

We allow and encourage the use of LLMs and AI tools as assistive aids for:

- Drafting code and prototypes
- Writing issues, PR descriptions, and comments
- Drafting RFCs and design documents
- Improving clarity of documentation
- Brainstorming GSoC proposals

However:

- You are fully responsible for the correctness, safety, and licensing of anything you submit.
- Do not paste proprietary, confidential, or non-redistributable material into LLMs.
- Ensure you understand and can explain any AI-generated code you contribute.
- For substantial AI-assisted content, note this briefly but explicitly in your PR or proposal.
- GSoC proposals must reflect your technical understanding and design thinking. LLMs may help with phrasing, but cannot replace ownership.


## Communication Guidelines

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/project-tirtha/tirtha-public/issues) for reporting bugs and actionable work.
- Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/project-tirtha/discussions) for open-ended questions and ideas.
- Use the [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#tirtha:matrix.org) for quick conversations and community interaction.

For community norms and behavior expectations, see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Bottom line: Be patient and kind. Contributors span time zones, cultures, and experience levels.

## Contributing as a Coder

### Before You Start

1. Read the repository [README](./README.md) to understand the project.
2. Browse the [Tirtha website](https://smlab.niser.ac.in/project/tirtha/) to understand the project from a user's perspective.
3. Skim [DEVELOP.md](./DEVELOP.md) for local development setup.
4. Browse open issues, especially those labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/project-tirtha/tirtha-public/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22).
5. Join the community via [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#tirtha:matrix.org) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/project-tirtha/discussions).

If anything is unclear, open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/project-tirtha/discussions) or ask in the [chat room](https://matrix.to/#/#tirtha:matrix.org).

### Development Workflow

> [!tip]
> You do not need a GPU for UI or documentation changes. GPU and CUDA are required for pipeline work.

For setup, please see [DEVELOP.md](./DEVELOP.md). If you are only working on the frontend (`Django` templates or `HTML/CSS/JS`), you may skip installing heavy backend dependencies; check [`DEVELOP.md`](./DEVELOP.md) for the `start-dev.sh` workflow.

1. [Fork](https://github.com/project-tirtha/tirtha-public/fork) the repository.
2. Create a branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <yourname>/<feature-short-desc>
   ```
3. Make focused, logical changes — one logical change per PR is preferred.
4. Commit with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "(feat) add XYZ pipeline stage to Tirtha backend"
   ```
5. Ensure you sync with the latest `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout <your-branch>
   git merge main
   ```
6. Push code and open a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/project-tirtha/tirtha-public/pulls).  Draft PRs are welcome and encouraged for early feedback.


**Pull Requests**

A good PR:

- Has a clear purpose.
- References a related issue if any.
- Explains what changed and why.
- Includes screenshots for UI changes.
- Includes benchmarks or notes for pipeline changes.

Maintainers may request changes. This is a normal part of FOSS collaboration.

**Issues and Bug Reports**

Use GitHub Issues for:

- [Bug reports](https://github.com/project-tirtha/tirtha-public/issues/new/choose)
- [Feature requests](https://github.com/project-tirtha/tirtha-public/issues/new/choose)

When opening an issue:

- Be clear and concise.
- Include logs, screenshots, or minimal reproduction steps if relevant.

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026

> [!important]
> Make sure to read the [LLM / AI Tool Usage](#llm--ai-tool-usage-policy) and [Communication Guidelines](#communication-guidelines) sections. Then, read the project ideas document linked in the [README](./README.md) before engaging.

We actively welcome GSoC 2026 contributors.

Guidelines:
<!-- (chore) Create links to both -->
- Join discussions early and introduce yourself (Matrix or GitHub Discussions).
- Make at least one small contribution before submitting a proposal. See issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/project-tirtha/tirtha-public/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) for small contribution ideas.
- Proposals should:
  - Reference concrete parts of the codebase
  - Include milestones and deliverables
  - Identify risks and mitigation strategies
  - Describe how you will engage with the community

We value initiative, clarity, and sustained engagement more than polished prose. Feel free to use this template for your proposal: [GSoC Proposal Template](TBD). We also encourage you to ask for feedback on your proposal drafts via GitHub Discussions or Matrix, long before the submission deadline.

---

## Contributing as a Non-Coder

Use GitHub Discussions for:

- Request for Comment Documents (RFCs) (for design or research proposals)
- **GSoC-related discussions**

For RFCs, describe:
  - The problem
  - Constraints
  - Your proposal
  - Alternatives considered

The same [LLM / AI Tool Usage Policy](#llm--ai-tool-usage-policy) applies.

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/project-tirtha/tirtha-public/issues/new/choose) or come chat with us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#tirtha:matrix.org) if you run into problems.

### If you want to contribute data for a heritage site
