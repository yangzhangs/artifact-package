## Restrictions on Generative AI Usage (AI Policy)

> [!NOTE]
> The following is adapted from [matplotlib's contributing guide](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/contribute.html#generative-ai) and the [Linux Kernel policy guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc./html/next/process/coding-assistants.html)

We expect authentic engagement in our community.

- Do not post output from Large Language Models or similar generative AI as comments on GitHub or our discord server, as such comments tend to be formulaic and low-quality content.
- If you use generative AI tools as an aid in developing code or documentation changes, ensure that you fully understand the proposed changes and can explain why they are the correct approach.

Make sure you have added value based on your personal competency to your contributions.
Just taking some input, feeding it to an AI and posting the result is not of value to the project.
To preserve precious core developer capacity, we reserve the right to rigorously reject seemingly AI generated low-value contributions.

### Signed-off-by and Developer Certificate of Origin

AI agents MUST NOT add Signed-off-by tags. Only humans can legally certify the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). The human submitter is responsible for:

- Reviewing all AI-generated code
- Ensuring compliance with licensing requirements
- Adding their own Signed-off-by tag to certify the DCO
- Taking full responsibility for the contribution

See [Signing your work](#signing-your-work) for more information.

### Attribution

When AI tools contribute to development, proper attribution helps track the evolving role of AI in the development process. Contributions should include an Assisted-by tag in the commit message with the following format:

```text
Assisted-by: AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION [TOOL1] [TOOL2]
```

Where:

- `AGENT_NAME` is the name of the AI tool or framework
- `MODEL_VERSION` is the specific model version used
- `[TOOL1] [TOOL2]` are optional specialized analysis tools used (e.g., coccinelle, sparse, smatch, clang-tidy)

Basic development tools (git, gcc, make, editors) should not be listed.

Example:

```text
Assisted-by: Claude:claude-3-opus coccinelle sparse
```
