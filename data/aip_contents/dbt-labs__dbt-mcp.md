# Contributing

With [task](https://taskfile.dev/) installed, simply run `task` to see the list of available commands. For comments, questions, or requests open a GitHub issue.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-mcp.git
cd dbt-mcp
```

2. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

3. [Install Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)

4. Run `task install`

5. Configure environment variables:

   ```shell
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then edit `.env` with your specific environment variables (see [our docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-ai/setup-local-mcp) to determine the values).

6. Run `task client` to chat with dbt MCP in your terminal.

## LLM-Assisted Contributions

We welcome contributions made with the help of AI coding assistants and LLMs. If you use LLMs, use them responsibly.

In practice, this means:

- **Review what was generated.** Don't submit code you haven't read and understood. LLMs can produce plausible-looking but incorrect logic, especially around edge cases.
- **Verify accuracy.** Check that generated code, logic, tool descriptions, and prompts are correct — inaccurate descriptions directly affect how AI assistants use these tools, and subtle logic errors may not be caught by tests alone.
- **Run the checks.** LLM-generated code must still pass `task check` and `task test:unit` before submitting a PR.
- **Show your work.** For non-trivial changes, include evidence of testing in your PR description (e.g., screenshots, logs, or a description of what you ran and observed). The burden of validation is on the author, not the reviewer.

The bar for contribution quality is the same regardless of how the code was written.

## Style

- Import modules at the top of Python files. Only import in the middle of code when strictly necessary, and document why.
- Never add unused parameters to a function, even with a default value.
- Only use default arguments when there is a reason to do so.
- Avoid `while True`. While-loops should have a termination condition in the `while` statement, not just in the loop body.
- Always use `*` in function parameter lists when there are adjacent parameters with the same type.
- Avoid putting code in `__init__.py` files.
- Always include type annotations for function inputs and outputs.
- Always prefer Pydantic models or dataclasses to dictionaries.

## Testing

### Unit Testing

This repo has automated tests which can be run with `task test:unit`.

### Integration Testing

The integration tests exercise system interactions greater than just the unit tests. They require a dbt Platform environment that is set up with semantic layer, developer license, and PAT. These tests can be run with `task test:integration`.

Integration tests must:

- Issue real HTTP requests against configured services — do not monkeypatch or stub network calls inside `tests/integration`.
- Build clients through the standard config providers so they pull credentials and endpoints from the environment.
- If request observations are needed, subclass the client to record metadata while still calling the real implementation.
- Use unit tests for mocking.

For dbt Labs employees, a staging environment has been set up. Credentials for this environment can be found by searching for `dbt MCP Integration Test Credentials` in 1Password.

### Manual Testing

To test in a client like Cursor or Claude, use a configuration file like this:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbt": {
      "command": "<path-to-uv>",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path-to-this-directory>/dbt-mcp",
        "run",
        "dbt-mcp",
        "--env-file",
        "<path-to-this-directory>/dbt-mcp/.env"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Or, if you would like to test with Oauth, use a configuration like this:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbt": {
      "command": "<path-to-uv>",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path-to-this-directory>/dbt-mcp",
        "run",
        "dbt-mcp",
      ],
      "env": {
        "DBT_HOST": "<dbt-host-with-custom-subdomain>",
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For improved debugging, you can set the `DBT_MCP_SERVER_FILE_LOGGING=true` environment variable to log to a `./dbt-mcp.log` file.

## Adding Tools

Tools are defined using the `@dbt_mcp_tool` decorator and registered with the MCP server via `register_tools()`.

### Steps to add a new tool

1. **Add a `ToolName` entry** in `src/dbt_mcp/tools/tool_names.py`
2. **Map it to a toolset** in `src/dbt_mcp/tools/toolsets.py` (e.g., `DISCOVERY`, `SEMANTIC_LAYER`, `SQL`)
3. **Write a prompt file** in `src/dbt_mcp/prompts/<category>/` describing the tool
4. **Define the tool function** in the appropriate `tools.py` module:
   ```python
   @dbt_mcp_tool(
       description=get_prompt("category/tool_name"),
       title="My Tool",
       read_only_hint=True,
       destructive_hint=False,
       idempotent_hint=True,
   )
   async def my_tool(context: MyToolContext, param: str) -> dict:
       return await context.fetcher.do_something(param)
   ```
5. **Add it to the tool list** (e.g., `DISCOVERY_TOOLS`) in the same module
6. The registration function (e.g., `register_discovery_tools`) handles context binding and registration

### Adding a tool with interactive UI (MCP Apps)

MCP Apps are tools that have an associated interactive UI rendered by the host (e.g., Claude, VS Code). They build on top of regular tools with two additions:

1. **Use `structured_output` and `meta`** to link the tool to a UI resource:
   ```python
   @dbt_mcp_tool(
       description=get_prompt("category/tool_name"),
       title="My Visualization",
       read_only_hint=True,
       structured_output=True,
       meta={"ui": {"resourceUri": "ui://dbt-mcp/my-app"}},
   )
   async def my_viz_tool(context: MyToolContext, param: str) -> MyResult:
       ...
   ```
   `structured_output=True` is required so the host can pass structured JSON to the UI. The return type should be a Pydantic model.

2. **Register an MCP resource** at the matching `ui://` URI to serve the HTML app:
   ```python
   @dbt_mcp.resource(
       uri="ui://dbt-mcp/my-app",
       name="My App",
       mime_type="text/html;profile=mcp-app",
   )
   def get_my_app_ui() -> str:
       return Path("packages/my-app/dist/index.html").read_text()
   ```

3. **Build a frontend** in `packages/` using `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`. The app receives tool results via the `ontoolresult` callback and must be bundled as a single HTML file (e.g., using `vite-plugin-singlefile`) or reference external resources via CSP `resourceDomains`.

The `ui://` URI convention is `ui://<server-name>/<resource-name>`. The `meta` field is passed through the full tool registration pipeline (`@dbt_mcp_tool` → `GenericToolDefinition` → `adapt_context` → `register_tools` → `FastMCP.add_tool`).

## Signed Commits

Before committing changes, ensure that you have set up [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
This repo requires signing on all commits for PRs.

## Changelog

Every PR requires a changelog entry. [Install changie](https://changie.dev/) and run `changie new` to create a new changelog entry.

## Debugging

The dbt-mcp server runs with `stdio` transport by default which does not allow for Python debugger support. For debugging with breakpoints, use `streamable-http` transport.

### Option 1: MCP Inspector Only (No Breakpoints)

1. Run `task inspector` - this starts both the server and inspector automatically
2. Open MCP Inspector UI
3. Use "STDIO" Transport Type to connect
4. Test tools interactively in the inspector UI (uses `stdio` transport, no debugger support)

### Option 2: VS Code Debugger with Breakpoints (Recommended for Debugging)

1. Set breakpoints in your code
2. Press `F5` or select "debug dbt-mcp" from the Run menu
3. Open MCP Inspector UI via `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
4. Connect to `http://localhost:8000/mcp/v1` using "Streamable HTTP" transport and "Via Proxy" connection type
5. Call tools from Inspector - your breakpoints will trigger

### Option 3: Manual Debugging with `task dev`

1. Run `task dev` - this starts the server with `streamable-http` transport on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Set breakpoints in your code
3. Attach your debugger manually (see [debugpy documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy#debugpy) for examples)
4. Open MCP Inspector via `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
5. Connect to `http://localhost:8000/mcp/v1` using "Streamable HTTP" transport and "Via Proxy" connection type
6. Call tools from Inspector - your breakpoints will trigger

**Note:** `task dev` uses `streamable-http` by default. The `streamable-http` transport allows the debugger and MCP Inspector to work simultaneously without conflicts. To override, use `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio task dev`.

If you encounter any problems, you can try running `task run` to see errors in your terminal.

## Release

Only people in the `CODEOWNERS` file should trigger a new release with these steps:

1. Consider these guidelines when choosing a version number:

- Major
  - Removing a tool or toolset without replacement, or in a way that would result in agents behaving much differently.
  - Changing the behavior of existing environment variables or configurations
- Minor
  - Changes to config system related to the function signature of the register functions (e.g. `register_discovery_tools`)
  - Adding optional parameters to a tool function signature
  - Adding a new tool or toolset
  - Removing or adding non-optional parameters from tool function signatures
  - Renaming a tool
  - Removing a tool which overlaps or provides similar functionality as other tool(s)
- Patch
  - Bug and security fixes - only major security and bug fixes will be back-ported to prior minor and major versions
  - Dependency updates which don’t change behavior
  - Minor enhancements
  - Editing a tool or parameter description prompt
  - Adding an allowed environment variable with the `DBT_MCP_` prefix

2. Trigger the [Create release PR Action](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-mcp/actions/workflows/create-release-pr.yml).

- If the release is NOT a pre-release, select `auto` (default) to automatically determine the version bump based on changelog entries, or manually pick patch, minor or major if needed
- If the release is a pre-release, set the bump and the pre-release suffix. We support alpha.N, beta.N and rc.N.
  - use alpha for early releases of experimental features that specific people might want to test. Significant changes can be expected between alpha and the official release.
  - use beta for releases that are mostly stable but still in development. It can be used to gather feedback from a group of peopleon how a specific feature should work.
  - use rc for releases that are mostly stable and already feature complete. Only bugfixes and minor changes are expected between rc and the official release.
- Picking the prerelease suffix will depend on whether the last release was the stable release or a pre-release:

| Last Stable | Last Pre-release | Bump  | Pre-release Suffix | Resulting Version |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1.2.0       | -                | minor | beta.1             | 1.3.0-beta.1      |
| 1.2.0       | 1.3.0-beta.1     | minor | beta.2             | 1.3.0-beta.2      |
| 1.2.0       | 1.3.0-beta.2     | minor | rc.1               | 1.3.0-rc.1        |
| 1.2.0       | 1.3.0-rc.1       | minor |                    | 1.3.0             |
| 1.2.0       | 1.3.0-beta.2     | minor | -                  | 1.3.0             |
| 1.2.0       | -                | major | rc.1               | 2.0.0-rc.1        |
| 1.2.0       | 2.0.0-rc.1       | major | -                  | 2.0.0             |

3. Get this PR approved & merged in (if the resulting release name is not the one expected in the PR, just close the PR and try again step 1)
4. This will trigger the `Release dbt-mcp` Action. On the `Summary` page of this Action a member of the `CODEOWNERS` file will have to manually approve the release. The rest of the release process is automated.
