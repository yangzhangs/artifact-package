## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

**Option 1: Traditional Setup**

- **Node.js** (>= 24.8.0) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/) or use nvm
- **pnpm** (>= 10.18.2) - Install with `npm install -g pnpm`
- **Docker** - For local database development
- **Rust** - For desktop app development (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Git** - For version control

**Option 2: Nix Development Environment (Recommended for Linux)**

If you're on Linux, you can use Nix to automatically set up a complete development environment with all dependencies:

- **Nix** (with flakes enabled) - [Install here](https://nixos.org/download.html)
- **direnv** (optional but recommended) - For automatic environment loading

See [Development with Nix](#development-with-nix) section below for setup instructions.

#### Linux System Dependencies

For Tauri development on Linux, you'll need additional system dependencies:

**Arch Linux / CachyOS / Manjaro:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed \
  webkit2gtk-4.1 \
  base-devel \
  curl \
  wget \
  file \
  openssl \
  gtk3 \
  libappindicator \
  librsvg \
  xdotool \
  gst-plugins-base \
  gst-plugins-good
```

**Note for Linux users:**

The application automatically sets WebKitGTK environment variables on Linux to handle:

- NVIDIA GPU rendering issues (GBM buffer errors)
- Blank page rendering on X11
- Wayland compatibility (including Hyprland)

These fixes are configured in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` and applied automatically:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

**Performance Note:** To ensure compatibility across different GPU drivers and display servers, hardware acceleration is partially disabled. This may result in reduced UI performance, which is a known trade-off for webkit2gtk compatibility on Linux.

The above packages include GStreamer plugins needed for media playback in webkit2gtk.

**Ubuntu / Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  build-essential \
  curl \
  wget \
  file \
  libssl-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  librsvg2-dev
```

**Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1-devel \
  openssl-devel \
  curl \
  wget \
  file \
  gtk3-devel
```

See [Tauri Prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for other distributions.

### Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deadlock-mod-manager.git
   cd deadlock-mod-manager
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Set up the development environment**:

   ```bash
   # Copy environment file
   cp env.example .env

   # Start the database
   docker compose up -d

   # Push database schema
   pnpm db:push
   ```

5. **Start development**:

   ```bash
   # For desktop app development (most common)
   pnpm desktop:dev

   # Or for API development
   pnpm api:dev
   ```

## Development Setup

### Environment Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Required for local development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://turborepo:123456789@localhost:5435/turborepo
NODE_ENV=development

# Optional services
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
```

### Database Setup

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
docker compose up -d

# Apply database schema
pnpm db:push

# Seed with initial data (optional)
pnpm db:seed
```

### Development with Nix

For Linux users, we provide a complete Nix flake that sets up your entire development environment with all required dependencies.

#### Why Use Nix?

- **Reproducible**: Everyone gets exactly the same environment
- **Complete**: Includes Rust, Node.js, pnpm, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, and all system libraries
- **Isolated**: Doesn't interfere with your system packages
- **Automatic**: With direnv, the environment activates automatically when you enter the project

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install Nix** (if not already installed):

   Follow the [official instructions](https://nixos.org/download.html).

2. **Install direnv** (optional but highly recommended):
   Then add this to your shell config (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   eval "$(direnv hook bash)"  # or 'zsh' for zsh
   ```

#### Quick Start with Nix

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deadlock-mod-manager.git
   cd deadlock-mod-manager
   ```

2. **Enable the Nix environment**:

   **With direnv** (automatic):

   ```bash
   direnv allow
   ```

   **Without direnv** (manual):

   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

3. **Install JavaScript dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   pnpm db:push
   ```

5. **Start developing**:

   ```bash
   pnpm desktop:dev
   ```

#### What's Included in the Nix Environment?

The Nix flake automatically provides:

- **Rust toolchain** with rust-analyzer and clippy
- **Node.js 22** with pnpm and bun
- **System libraries** for Tauri (GTK, WebKit, etc.)
- **Development tools** (biome, turbo, lefthook, oxlint, oxfmt)
- **Database tools** (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Build tools** (gcc, make, pkg-config)
- **CLI utilities** (ripgrep, fd, jq)

#### Building the Nix Package

To build the desktop app as a Nix package:

```bash
# Build the nightly package
nix build .#nightly

# Run the built package
./result/bin/deadlock-mod-manager

# Or build and run directly
nix run .#nightly
```

#### Troubleshooting

**Q: The environment isn't loading automatically**

- Make sure you ran `direnv allow` in the project directory
- Check that direnv is properly hooked in your shell config

**Q: Build fails with "hash mismatch"**

- The dependency hashes in `flake.nix` may need updating
- Check the GitHub Actions CI logs for the correct hashes

**Q: Docker isn't working**

- Make sure your user is in the `docker` group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
- You may need to log out and back in for group changes to take effect

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

```bash
feature/add-mod-filtering
bugfix/fix-download-progress
hotfix/security-vulnerability
chore/update-dependencies
docs/improve-api-documentation
```

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Examples:**

```bash
feat(desktop): add mod search functionality
fix(api): handle pagination edge cases
docs(readme): update installation instructions
chore(deps): update Tauri to v2.1.0
```

### Git Hooks

The project uses Lefthook for git hooks that automatically:

- Format code with Biome
- Run linting checks
- Stage fixed files

These run automatically on commit, but you can also run them manually:

```bash
pnpm format:fix
pnpm lint:fix
```

## Worktree Development (Parallel Branches)

For working on multiple features or bug fixes simultaneously, we recommend using git worktrees. This lets you have multiple branches checked out at once without stashing or switching.

### Windows (wtx)

Install [wtx](https://github.com/littlesmilelove/worktree.ps), a PowerShell 7+ CLI for managing worktrees:

```powershell
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/littlesmilelove/worktree.ps.git
pwsh -File worktree.ps/install.ps1

# Reload your profile
. $PROFILE
```

Then initialize it in the repo and start using it:

```powershell
wtx init                          # Run once inside the repo
wtx add fix-mod-conflict          # Creates ../deadlock-modmanager.fix-mod-conflict
wtx fix-mod-conflict              # Jump to that worktree
wtx main                          # Jump back to main repo
wtx rm fix-mod-conflict --yes     # Clean up when done
```

The repo is pre-configured (`.wtx.kv`) to automatically copy `.env`, `.env.local`, and `.tauri/` keys, run `pnpm install`, and start `pnpm dev` in new worktrees.

### Linux / macOS (git-worktree-runner)

Install [git-worktree-runner (gtr)](https://github.com/coderabbitai/git-worktree-runner):

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew tap coderabbitai/tap
brew install git-gtr

# Linux / macOS (script)
git clone https://github.com/coderabbitai/git-worktree-runner.git
cd git-worktree-runner
./install.sh
```

Then use it:

```bash
git gtr new fix-mod-conflict              # Create a worktree
git gtr new fix-mod-conflict --editor     # Create and open in editor
git gtr list                              # List all worktrees
git gtr rm fix-mod-conflict               # Remove when done
git gtr clean --merged                    # Clean up merged worktrees
```

After creating a worktree, remember to copy environment files and install dependencies:

```bash
cp .env .env.local ../deadlock-modmanager.fix-mod-conflict/
cp -r .tauri ../deadlock-modmanager.fix-mod-conflict/
cd ../deadlock-modmanager.fix-mod-conflict && pnpm install
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles

- **TypeScript First**: Always provide proper type definitions, never use `any`
- **Functional Components**: Use React functional components with hooks
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write clear, readable code with meaningful names
- **Static Imports**: Use static imports at the top of files
- **Memory Efficiency**: Use streaming APIs for large file operations

### Formatting

The project uses Biome with these settings:

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Line Width**: 80 characters
- **Line Ending**: LF
- **Semicolons**: Always
- **Trailing Commas**: Always
- **Quote Style**: Single quotes for JSX

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for specific package
pnpm --filter api test
pnpm --filter desktop test
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit Tests**: For utilities, hooks, and individual components
- **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints and complex workflows
- **E2E Tests**: For critical user journeys

### Test Guidelines

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

All translations live on Crowdin: **[translate.deadlockmods.app](https://translate.deadlockmods.app/)**. The English source (`apps/desktop/src/locales/en.json`) is the only locale file edited directly in the repo - all other locales are synced back from Crowdin via the [Crowdin GitHub action](.github/workflows/crowdin.yml).

### Contributing a Translation

1. Go to [translate.deadlockmods.app](https://translate.deadlockmods.app/) and sign in
2. Pick a language and translate strings in the Crowdin editor
3. Approved translations are automatically proposed as a PR on this repo

### Requesting a New Language

Open a request on Crowdin, or [file an issue](https://github.com/deadlock-mod-manager/deadlock-mod-manager/issues/new) and mention it in the [#translations](https://discord.com/channels/1322369530386710568/1414203136939135067) Discord channel.

### Adding or Changing Source Strings

If you're adding UI strings, add them to `apps/desktop/src/locales/en.json` in your PR. Once merged to `main`, the Crowdin action uploads the new strings automatically.

### Translation Guidelines

- **Keep context**: Understand the UI context before translating
- **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology throughout
- **Length**: Keep translations roughly the same length as originals
- **Placeholders**: Don't translate placeholders like `{{username}}`

### Supported Languages

Check the [README language table](README.md#currently-supported-languages) for current translation status.

## Community Guidelines

# Standalone AI policy file

# AI Contribution Policy

> **Last updated:** February 2026

## Our Stance

Deadlock Mod Manager is built with AI assistance, and we're not shy about it. Our [Cursor configuration](https://github.com/deadlock-mod-manager/deadlock-mod-manager/tree/main/.cursor) is included in the repo because we believe AI tools are a legitimate and powerful part of the modern developer toolkit.

That said, AI tools amplify the skill of the person using them. A good developer with AI becomes faster. A developer who doesn't understand what they're contributing becomes a burden on maintainers, regardless of how the code was produced.

**This is not an anti-AI policy. This is a pro-accountability policy.**

## Rules for Contributors

### 1. You Own What You Submit

Every line in your pull request is your responsibility. If you used AI to generate code, you must:

- **Understand it fully.** If a maintainer asks why you made a specific choice, "the AI suggested it" is not an acceptable answer.
- **Have tested it.** AI-generated code must pass the same quality bar as hand-written code: linting, type checking, and manual verification.
- **Be able to modify it.** If a reviewer asks for changes, you should be able to make them without re-prompting an AI from scratch.

### 2. Disclose AI Usage

When opening a pull request that involved significant AI assistance (beyond autocomplete or minor suggestions), please note it in the PR description. A simple line is enough:

```
AI Assistance: Used [tool] for [what it helped with]
```

**Examples of what to disclose:**

- "Used Cursor to scaffold the initial component structure, then refined manually"
- "Claude helped debug the Rust compilation issue in the VPK parser"
- "GitHub Copilot generated the test cases, reviewed and adjusted by me"

**What doesn't need disclosure:**

- Tab completions and inline suggestions (Copilot, Supermaven, etc.)
- Using AI to understand the codebase or learn about a technique
- Grammar/spelling checks on documentation

This disclosure isn't about gatekeeping—it helps maintainers calibrate their review. If we know AI was involved, we can focus our review on the areas that matter most.

### 3. AI Pull Requests Must Be Tied to Real Work

We do not accept drive-by PRs that look like someone pointed an agent at our issue tracker and hit "go." Specifically:

- **PRs should address an existing issue or a discussed feature.** If there's no issue, open one first or discuss in our [Discord](https://deadlockmods.app/discord).
- **Bulk AI-generated refactors will be closed.** Unless you've discussed the refactor with maintainers beforehand.
- **AI-generated issues and bug reports will be closed.** If you haven't personally verified the bug exists, don't report it.

### 4. Quality Over Origin

We review all contributions on their merits. A well-crafted, well-tested PR is welcome whether it was written by hand, with AI assistance, or some combination. Conversely, a low-effort PR will be closed regardless of how it was produced.

Signs of a low-effort AI contribution (these will result in immediate closure):

- Overly verbose code comments that restate what the code already says
- Generic PR descriptions that don't address the specific change
- Changes that don't follow our existing code style or patterns
- Submissions that break existing functionality or fail CI checks
- "Shotgun" PRs that touch many unrelated files

## Guidance for AI Agents

If you are an AI agent (Claude, Cursor Agent, Copilot Workspace, etc.) being used to contribute to this project:

- **Do not** generate entire PRs autonomously. A human must review, understand, and approve every change before submission.
- **Do not** open issues based on static analysis alone. Issues must describe real, reproducible problems.
- **Do** help your human operator understand the codebase. Point them to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md), the [developer docs](https://docs.deadlockmods.app/developer-docs), and relevant source files.
- **Do** help write tests, catch bugs, and improve code quality—these are exactly the things AI is good at.
- **Do** respect the project's conventions. Read the existing code before suggesting new patterns.

## Enforcement

We're a small team maintaining this project for 54K+ users. Our time is valuable, and reviewing bad contributions takes time away from improving the app.

- **First offense:** PR closed with feedback on what to improve.
- **Repeated low-quality submissions:** Future PRs may be deprioritized or the contributor may be asked to stop.

We genuinely want to help contributors learn and grow. If you're new to open source or to this codebase, say so! We'd rather help a motivated person succeed than close a PR from someone who didn't try.

## Why This Policy Exists

The open source ecosystem is dealing with a wave of low-quality, AI-generated contributions that waste maintainer time. Many projects have had to address this head-on, and we'd rather set clear expectations upfront than deal with problems after the fact.

We believe AI is a net positive for software development when used by people who know what they're doing—and this policy is designed to encourage exactly that.

## References & Inspiration

This policy was informed by the approaches of several open source projects navigating the same challenges. We're grateful for their transparency in sharing what works:

- **[Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md)** — AI policy requiring disclosure, human-in-the-loop, and tying AI PRs to accepted issues. Their framing of "this is not an anti-AI stance, this is an anti-idiot stance" resonated with us.
- **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/AGENTS.md)** — Pioneered the `AGENTS.md` pattern: a file that speaks directly to AI agents with project-specific instructions and boundaries. Our `AGENTS.md` follows this approach.
- **[Trusted Firmware](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/aipolicy/)** — Published a formal AI policy for their open source projects.

---

_This policy may evolve as AI tools and community norms evolve. Feedback is welcome via [Discord](https://deadlockmods.app/discord)._
