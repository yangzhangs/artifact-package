## Contribution Authorship And AI Use

- Contributors are expected to write and own their submitted code, issue reports, PR descriptions, and review summaries. AI-generated content submitted as one's own work will not be accepted.
- Contributors must be able to explain, test, and defend any substantive change. If a contributor cannot clearly explain what changed and why, the submission may be rejected regardless of how it was produced.
- Maintainers evaluate submissions on correctness, clarity, test coverage, and the contributor's demonstrated understanding of the change.
- Assistive use is permitted for spelling, grammar, minor cleanups, and supplemental research. If AI tools played a meaningful role in producing a contribution, please disclose that in the PR.
- This policy governs what gets submitted to Skylos, **NOT** every private tool used in the background. We are taking a stricter posture for now because review capacity is limited and the project quality bar is high.

## Code Style
- You can look at our code and just follow it accordingly. Try your best to follow best practices. 

## Precision Policy

- Treat the corpus as a required regression guard for dead-code precision.
- If you fix a confirmed false positive or precision regression, add a minimal fixture under `corpus/fixtures/` that isolates the runtime contract or language pattern.
- Register the case in `corpus/manifest.json` with narrow expectations and a source link to the upstream framework or library pattern that motivated it.
- Keep fixtures small and pattern-focused. The corpus should protect specific contracts, not attempt to model an entire framework in one file.
- Prefer explicit contracts over broad heuristic suppression. If a pattern is plausible but not proven, keep the rule narrow or lower confidence instead of hard-suppressing it.
- Do not relax or remove an existing corpus expectation unless the original pattern was invalid or the contract changed.
