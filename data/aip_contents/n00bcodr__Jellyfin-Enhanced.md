## 📝 Code Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

1. **Comments are Essential**

   - Use JSDoc comments for functions and classes
   - Add inline comments to explain complex logic
   - Document parameters, return values, and side effects

   Example:
   ```javascript
   /**
    * Creates a bookmark at the specified timestamp
    * @param {string} itemId - The Jellyfin item ID
    * @param {number} timestamp - The video timestamp in seconds
    * @param {string} label - User-provided label for the bookmark
    * @returns {Promise<Object>} The created bookmark object
    */
   async function createBookmark(itemId, timestamp, label) {
       // Validate timestamp is within video duration
       if (timestamp > videoDuration) {
           throw new Error('Timestamp exceeds video duration');
       }

       // Create bookmark object with metadata
       const bookmark = {
           id: generateId(),
           itemId,
           timestamp,
           label,
           createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
       };

       return await saveBookmark(bookmark);
   }
   ```

2. **Code Understanding**

   - Ensure you understand what your changes do
   - Be prepared to answer questions about your implementation

3. **AI-Assisted Code (VibeCoded PRs)**

   - AI-assisted contributions are welcome! However:
     - You must understand what the code does
     - Be able to explain your implementation
     - Respond to code review comments
     - Clearly indicate in your PR description that AI tools were used

   Example PR description:
   ```markdown
